<html><body><p><strong>Apple (AAPL) </strong>is trading modestly higher after the company reported Q2 (Mar) results last night. The quarter's headline numbers were decent, and the company also announced a 5% increase to its dividend and added $90 bln to its share repurchase program. However, certain cautious comments about Q3 (Jun) are keeping keep a lid on the stock today. </p><ul><li><strong>The headline numbers included solid beats</strong> on EPS and revenue. After missing a couple of quarters ago, Apple has now rebounded with sturdy upside in back-to-back quarters. </li><li><strong>iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Services all performed better</strong> than analyst expectations (see 16:38 InPlay comment for specific comparisons) despite supply constraints. Results for Wearables were maybe a slight miss, but that blemish was minor overall. </li><li> As a standout, iPhone revenue grew 5% yr/yr to $50.57 bln, well ahead of expectations. Analysts had been expecting the category to post a slight decline due to supply constraint concerns and the impact of lapping a tough comparison from the prior-year period. iPhone is by far Apple's largest category (52% of total revs), so its unexpected growth was particularly welcome. </li><li>The Wearables segment, which reported somewhat underwhelming results, has doubled in three years and is nearly the size of a Fortune 100 business in its own right, posting $8.81 bln in MarQ revs. Apple believes that it can pursue substantial growth by attracting customers who are new to Wearables. For example, over two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch are new to the product. </li></ul><p><strong>So, why is the stock not higher? </strong>We view Apple's cautious comments about JunQ as the main problem. Apple did not provide specific guidance, but it expects JunQ to be more severely impacted by supply constraints caused by COVID-related disruptions and industry-wide silicon shortages. Demand remains robust, but disruptions are making it harder to meet customer demand. Apple anticipates that constraints could impact revenue in the $4-8 bln range, which is substantially larger than the MarQ impact. </p><p> <strong>Overall, we are not seeing a lot wrong with the MarQ results. </strong>In fact, we are impressed that the numbers were this good considering the supply constraints. The JunQ comments were troubling, although not entirely unexpected given the COVID lockdowns in China. Investors may have been expecting and pricing in cautious guidance, which may explain why the stock is holding up fairly well in the wake of the company's earnings press.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
