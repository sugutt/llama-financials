<html><body><p><strong>Microsoft (MSFT)</strong> is set to report Q3 (Mar) results today after the close with a call to follow at 5:30pm ET. The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for non-GAAP EPS is $1.78 and for revenue it's $40.85 bln. MSFT releases its results on its website, last time it was at 16:08 ET. </p><p>Microsoft operates in several areas and it's important to know the breakdown by segment: Productivity and Business Processes (Office 365, LinkedIn, Dynamics 365, which are cloud-based ERP and CRM apps), Intelligent Cloud (Azure, SQL Server, Windows Server), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Surface, Xbox). </p><p>It's important to note that MSFT typically guides on the call by segment. MSFT has guided to MarQ segments as follows: </p><ul><li>Productivity and Business Processes (PBP) revenue of $13.35-13.60 bln. </li><li> Intelligent Cloud (IC): $14.70-14.95 bln. </li><li> More Personal Computing (MPC): $12.30-12.70 bln. Add all three together, we get total revenue of $40.35-41.25 bln </li></ul><p>MSFT tends to be very consistent in terms of beating consensus estimates with 19 EPS beats in a row, including double digit EPS beats in seven of the past eight quarters. Last quarter, the software giant reported another large EPS beat with its Q2 (Dec) earnings report with $0.62 upside, following a $0.46 beat in SepQ. In terms of revenue, MSFT reported strong upside relative to prior guidance in all three segments in DecQ. These robust results have likely increased expectations heading into MarQ. </p><p>Drilling down a bit, Microsoft's crown jewel has been its Azure cloud computing business which primarily competes <strong>Amazon's (AMZN)</strong> AWS service. Revenue growth in DecQ bumped up to 50% yr/yr, up from 48% growth in SepQ and 47% growth in JunQ. Investors will be looking for continued strength here. However, as we lap the start of the pandemic, there could be some choppiness with Azure in the next few quarters. </p><p>On a final note, MSFT's Azure rival Amazon is set to report Q1 earnings this week (Apr 29 after the close). Azure's performance should give us a window into what to expect for AWS.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
