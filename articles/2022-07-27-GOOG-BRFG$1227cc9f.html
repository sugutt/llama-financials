<html><body><p>For the first time in many years, Google parent <strong>Alphabet</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>) missed EPS expectations in back-to-back quarters as revenue growth slowed to just 13% in 2Q22. The only time in the past five years that GOOG generated slower growth was in 2Q20, when revenue fell by 1.7% due to the COVID-related economic shutdown. Despite these blemishes, the stock has reacted favorably to a report that can be best described as better-than-feared.<br><br>Unquestionably, <strong>Snap's</strong> (<strong>SNAP</strong>) gloomy earnings report from last week significantly lowered the bar for GOOG, which slid lower by nearly 10% in the aftermath of those results. However, SNAP's report only served to amplify the existing weakness in GOOG shares. Since early April, GOOG has spiraled lower by over 25%. The main point is that a soft Q2 earnings report was already priced in, setting the stage for a buy-the-dip reaction following the report.<br><br>Drilling down on the actual results, GOOG's performance was mediocre-at-best in Q2.</p><ul><li>While advertising revenue of $56.3 bln modestly beat analysts' estimates, growth slowed appreciably to 12% from 22% last quarter. To be fair, GOOG lapped a very challenging quarter in which advertising revenue surged by 69% in 2Q21. The problem, though, is that advertisers are slowing their spending and that the pullback isn't reversing higher.<ul><li>The segment that's feeling the greatest impact from this decline in ad spending is YouTube. In Q2, YouTube ad revenue increased by a pedestrian 4.8% to $7.34 bln, missing expectations.</li><li>More so than GOOG's traditional search business, YouTube is prone to competitive pressures from short video platform provider TikTok. To answer this competitive threat, GOOG is focused on growing YouTube Shorts, which now has over 30 bln daily views. Monetizing YouTube Shorts is still a work in progress and will take more time to develop.</li></ul></li><li>The deceleration in revenue growth isn't relegated to GOOG's advertising business. Google Cloud posted growth of 36%, representing a material drop off from the mid-40% growth that investors have become accustomed to.<ul><li>This suggests that enterprises are also scaling back a bit on IT investments after a few years of rampant spending. GOOG still expects its Cloud segment to benefit from the digitization of businesses and the need for data analytics and security. Enterprises may be more judicious and tactical with their spending, though, as macroeconomic concerns mount.</li></ul></li><li>Surprisingly, GOOG's expenses grew faster than its revenue, even as the company recently stated that it's slowing its hiring. Operating expenses were up by 24% to $20.1 bln, mainly driven by higher headcount, and increased spending on advertising. As a result, operating margin slipped by 3 percentage points yr/yr to 28%.<ul><li>During the earnings call, CFO Ruth Porat reiterated that the company plans to slow the pace of hiring, so we should see a moderation in operating expenses in 2H22.</li></ul></li><li>A recurring theme this earnings season is that foreign exchange effects are creating a top-line headwind. GOOG is not an exception as the strengthening dollar created a 3.7 percentage point headwind in Q2. Worse yet, the company expects an even larger FX headwind in Q3.</li></ul><p>Financial highlights were few and far between for GOOG in Q2, but its results look much better when stacked up against SNAP's dismal performance. GOOG's significant exposure to the travel industry, combined with a more diversified business due to its Cloud segment, give it an edge over SNAP and other advertising-centric companies like <strong>Meta Platforms</strong> (<strong>META</strong>). It's difficult to get too excited about GOOG's results, however, since advertising spending is in a lull. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
