<html><body><p><strong>Microsoft (MSFT +4%)</strong> is going against the trend today. While many tech names are trading lower today after reporting earnings (<strong>FFIV, GOOG, JNPR, TXN</strong>), Microsoft is moving higher. Initially, we thought the market might react negatively to the company's modest EPS upside, as Microsoft broke its string of six consecutive double-digit EPS beats. However, bullish comments offered during the earnings call have spurred the stock higher. </p><p>The modest beat was not the only problem that we saw in the report. MSFT reports revenue growth by product, and results were mixed on that basis; some categories grew relative to last quarter while others declined. We had expected to see more consistent improvement. </p><p> <strong>So, why is the stock higher?</strong> </p><ul><li>Revenue growth for Azure, a category we watch closely, came in at just 46% for the second quarter in a row. That is a step down from the 50-51% growth posted in prior quarters. However, Azure was up 49% on a constant currency basis; MSFT faced tough FX headwinds in MarQ. Also, the results were ahead of internal expectations, and MSFT's guidance f for a 2-pt sequential decline (constant currency) in JunQ is a bit better than expected. </li><li>Azure's growth has been robust in terms of its consumption-based business. However, its per-user business growth has been moderating given the huge size of its install base. We think investors have been expecting some moderation to transpire, so the declines are not a huge surprise. Also, Azure can have quarterly variability primarily on the per user side. </li><li>Gaming was a definite bright spot. With its Xbox Series S and X consoles, MSFT has taken share globally for two quarters in a row. Also, MSFT identified itself as the market leader this quarter among next-gen consoles in the US, Canada, UK, and Western Europe. In its consumer business generally, MSFT saw market share gains across PCs, gaming consoles, and its Edge browser. </li><li>In further bullish commentary, during the Q&amp;A, CEO Satya Nadella said that among its customers, MSFT is not seeing businesses looking to their IT budgets or digital transformation projects as the place to implement cuts amid a volatile macro backdrop. He commented that he "[has] not seen this level of demand for automation technology to improve productivity, because in an inflationary environment, the only deflationary force is software." A statement like this can really soothe investors' nerves. </li></ul><p><strong>Overall, this was a solid quarter for Microsoft.</strong> Though the company's headline numbers were not as robust as usual, Azure held up well and gaming was strong. The Azure numbers bode well for Amazon (AMZN), and its rival AWS segment, which reports tomorrow after the close. Finally, the January tech sell-off has taken a big bite out of MSFT, which makes us continue to think it's worth a look on this pullback. Its business is quite strong all around, and managements' comments regarding IT spending are encouraging.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
