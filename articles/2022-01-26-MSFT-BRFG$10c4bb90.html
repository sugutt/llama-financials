<html><body><p><strong>Microsoft (MSFT 300.57, +12.08, +4.2%)</strong> has "LinkedIn" with the market today. After the stock dropped initially following the company's Q2 (Dec) earnings report last night, it was encouraging to see the stock rally off its lows thanks to a positive earnings call and upside revenue guidance for Q3 (Mar). </p><p> We think the stock's initial drop was likely a response to the company's bottom line result. The quarter's EPS beat, while good, was not as gaudy as the beats of recent quarters. Also, many of the product categories in the PBP and IC segments showed yr/yr growth that was lower than their SepQ growth. The most glaring number was probably Azure, which had consistently been growing in the 50% range; its growth dipped to 46% yr/yr in DecQ vs 50% growth in SepQ, 51% growth in JunQ, and 50% growth in MarQ. </p><p> The good news is that MSFT calmed a lot of fears during its largely bullish call, so let's dig into it. </p><ul><li> <strong>Intelligent Cloud (IC) was by far the fastest growing segment</strong>, with revenue up 26% yr/yr to $18.30 bln, at the higher end of guidance of $18.10-18.35 bln. However, as a nitpick, MSFT beat prior guidance in SepQ while DecQ was at the higher end. Also, the 26% growth was not quite as strong as SepQ's 31% growth. Azure's drop to 46% growth, a decent dip relative to recent quarters, is also housed under IC's results. </li><li><strong>On the call, MSFT delivered relief</strong> by reminding investors that Azure can experience quarterly variability, primarily through its per user business. While MSFT did not provide specific guidance for Azure, it did say that Azure revenue growth should be up sequentially in constant currency in MarQ. Unlike <strong>Amazon (AMZN)</strong>, which provides a lot of detail for its AWS unit, MSFT does not provide a hard revenue number for Azure. Nevertheless, we liked the directional commentary. </li><li> <strong>The Productivity and Business Processes (PBP) segment fared well also;</strong> revenues grew 19% yr/yr to $15.90 bln. Like in the IC segment, the PBP segment's result was at the high end of guidance following a beat in SepQ. Also, growth slowed a bit to 19% from 22% in SepQ. Most of the PBP categories slowed as well. LinkedIn continued to shine thanks to a strong job market with +37% growth, but it lagged compared to its +42% growth last quarter. </li><li><strong>The star of the show in DecQ was MSFT's More Personal Computing (MPC) segment</strong>, which is not surprising because PCs, Surface, and game consoles are popular holiday gift ideas. Windows OEM revenue jumped 25%, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by a strong PC market, particularly in the Commercial segment, and supported by the launch of Windows 11. Even Surface came through - revs rose 8% yr/yr, a nice bounce back from a -17% decline in SepQ. </li></ul><p><strong>Bottom line</strong>, it looked like the stock was going to be in for a rough day today. The company delivered another great quarter, but the period was maybe not as stellar as recent quarters. However, the call eased a lot of fears, especially with regards to the Azure dip. Also, the upside guidance for MarQ was a big relief for investors. Finally, the January tech sell-off has taken a big bite out of MSFT, which makes us think it's worth a look on this pullback. Its business is quite strong all around.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
