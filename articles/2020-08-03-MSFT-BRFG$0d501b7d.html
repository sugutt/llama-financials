<html><body><p><strong>Microsoft (MSFT +4%)</strong> announced over the weekend in a blog post that, following a conversation between CEO Satya Nadella and President Trump, Microsoft will continue discussions to explore a purchase of TikTok, a video sharing app that has become very popular, especially among younger people in the US. </p><p>  There have been concerns that the app, which is owned by China-based ByteDance, could be collecting data on US citizens and that the app could possibly be used to spread Chinese propaganda. Microsoft says that it fully appreciates these concerns and, if a deal can be reached on price, that it would subject TikTok to a complete security review.  </p><p><strong>Why would Microsoft want to buy TikTok? </strong>Microsoft has been mostly focused on enterprise corporate clients. While it has exposure on the consumer side with its very popular Xbox, Minecraft, and Surface businesses, MSFT does not have much exposure on the social media front. TikTok would serve as a prize property in that regard given its huge popularity.  </p><p>A problem we have is that we do not know for certain what TikTok's financials look like. However, according to app-tracking firm SensorTower.com, revenue in 2019 jumped to nearly $177 mln, more than 5x its 2018 levels. TikTok also saw more than 738 mln downloads in 2019. We do not have data in terms of profits, and the company may be unprofitable. However, given MSFT's large size, TikTok's potential losses are unlikely to have a big impact on MSFT's overall results.</p><p>  <strong>TikTok sort of reminds us of YouTube in its early days,</strong> and look at what that has grown into, with YouTubeTV now competing with cable as a streaming TV viewership service. We could see the same thing happening with TikTok down the road. Also, because TikTok's user base skews younger, TikTok would be very attractive to advertisers, who tend to prefer that demographic because its members are yet not as set in their ways in terms of brand loyalties relative to older consumers. </p><p> <strong>Overall, we think this would be a pretty bold move for MSFT</strong>, allowing it to buy a burgeoning name in the social media arena. We see TikTok as sort of a crown jewel in social media. And while MSFT is likely to pay a pretty penny, the price would only likely go up in the next few years as TikTok continues to grow. The movement in MSFT's stock price today shows investors like this deal.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
