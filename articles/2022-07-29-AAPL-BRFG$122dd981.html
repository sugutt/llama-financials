<html><body><p><strong>Apple (AAPL +2%)</strong> is trading nicely higher after reporting Q3 (Jun) results last night. </p><ul><li> <strong>The headline numbers of a nice EPS beat and in-line revs were quite good,</strong> especially in light of FX headwinds. Also, last quarter Apple prepared investors to brace for ugly supply chain constraints in JunQ. As it turns out, the constraints were not as bad as expected, which was a big relief for investors. </li><li><strong>iPhone was the star of the show </strong>with revenue coming in much better than expected. Analysts had been expecting a slight yr/yr sales decline, but revenue grew 3% yr/yr to $40.67 bln. Apple set a JunQ record for both revenue and switchers to iPhone. Customers see iPhone as the gold standard for smartphones and they have been raving about the iPhone 13's camera quality with features like cinematic mode and macro photography. </li><li><strong>iPad also came in better than expected.</strong> However, Mac, Wearables and Services were a bit light (see 16:39 InPlay for specific comparisons). Apple cited supply constraints and FX headwinds for these categories not performing quite as well as expected. </li><li>Looking ahead to SepQ, Apple chose not to provide revenue guidance, which was a bit of a letdown. However, it did say it expects yr/yr revenue growth will accelerate during SepQ relative to JunQ. More importantly, it expects supply constraints to be lower in SepQ than what it experienced during JunQ. However, gross margin guidance of 41.5-42.5% is a bit below the 43.2% achieved in JunQ. </li></ul><p><strong>The key takeaway from this report</strong> is that the JunQ supply chain constraints turned out to be less of an issue than the pessimistic view Apple presented on its last call. And SepQ should be even better than JunQ. This is a huge relief for investors as Apple's commentary on the last call was about as bearish we have ever heard them on supply chain issues. The other standout in this report was robust iPhone sales, and that is despite the fact that Apple is likely to launch iPhone 14 in just a few months. Overall, Apple does what it does. It handled a tough supply situation quite well and reminded investors why it is such a great company that cannot be held down for long.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
