<html><body><p><strong>Microsoft (MSFT)</strong> is set to report Q2 (Dec) results today after the close with a call to follow at 5:30pm ET. The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for non-GAAP EPS is $1.64 and for revenue it's $40.23 bln. Microsoft operates in several areas and it's important to know the breakdown by segment: Productivity and Business Processes (Office 365, LinkedIn, Dynamics 365, which are cloud-based ERP and CRM apps), Intelligent Cloud (Azure, SQL Server, Windows Server), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Surface, Xbox). </p><p>It's important to note that MSFT typically guides on the call by segment. For DecQ, MSFT has previously guided for its segments as follows: </p><ul><li><strong>Productivity and Business Processes (PBP)</strong> revenue of $12.75-13.00 bln. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365. LinkedIn should see an improved advertising market. </li><li> <strong>Intelligent Cloud (IC)</strong> revenue is expected at $13.55-13.80 bln. Azure growth will be driven by its consumption-based business while the per-user business should see growth moderate.  </li><li><strong>More Personal Computing (MPC)</strong> revenue of $13.20-13.60 bln. Windows will be lapping a strong prior year result. </li></ul><p><strong>A key area to watch will be Xbox sales as MSFT released a new console</strong> (Xbox Series X) this past holiday season for the first time in three years. Also, Microsoft's crown jewel has been its Azure cloud computing business which primarily competes Amazon's (AMZN) AWS service. In Q1 (Sep), Azure revenue rose a healthy 48%, a slight uptick from 47% growth in Q4 (Jun). Another bright spot has been Dynamics 365, which is a suite of ERP and CRM applications for businesses. It grew by 38% yr/yr in SepQ. </p><p><strong>MSFT tends to be very consistent in terms of beating consensus estimates</strong> with 18 EPS beats in a row, including double digit EPS beats in six of the past seven quarters, including a huge $0.46 beat in SepQ. </p><p><strong>A potential concern was from IBM's earnings report last week.</strong> IBM said that the pandemic and broader macro uncertainty has been putting additional pressure on larger software transactions and project delays. We'll be looking closely for any discussion if MSFT is seeing any softness with its enterprise customers. On the other hand, enterprise software giant SAP, and MSFT partner, provided encouraging Q4 guidance on Jan 14. We should get a good sense of the enterprise market with this report. </p><p><strong>On a final note, MSFT's Azure rival Amazon is set to report Q4 earnings next week </strong>(Feb 2 after the close). Azure's performance should give us a window into what to expect for AWS next week. (PVIEW)</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
