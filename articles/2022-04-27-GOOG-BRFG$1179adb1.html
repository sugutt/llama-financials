<html><body><p><strong>Alphabet's</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>) string of blowout earnings reports ended abruptly last night as the company's red-hot advertising business cooled off in 1Q22, leading to its first EPS miss since 1Q20. The disappointing results didn't catch investors completely off-guard, however, since <strong>Snap's</strong> (<strong>SNAP</strong>) downside report last week telegraphed some softness in the online advertising space. Still, there was hope that GOOG's dominance in search and its more limited exposure to <strong>Apple's</strong> (<strong>AAPL</strong>) iOS privacy changes would save the day.<br><br aria-hidden="true">There are a few main reasons why a positive surprise didn't come to fruition, and none of them bode well for <strong>Meta Platforms</strong> (<strong>FB</strong>), which is slated to report earnings after today's close.</p><ul><li>Although GOOG CEO Sundar Pichai didn't call out TikTok by name during the earnings conference call, it was evident that the social media app was top of mind when he highlighted short-form videos as a new growth opportunity. Recall that during FB's Q4 earnings call in early February, CEO Mark Zuckerberg similarly discussed how the company was working on monetizing Reels, its answer to TikTok's popular short-form videos.<ul><li>Not only is TikTok cutting into user engagement across FB's platforms, but it's also making a serious dent in YouTube's growth. In Q1, YouTube advertising revenue slowed to 14% from 25% last quarter.</li><li>To address the competitive threat, GOOG is now testing ads in YouTube shorts, which average over 30 bln views per day. One concern, though, is that YouTube shorts could cannibalize advertising revenue from the core video business.</li></ul></li><li>Only 1% of GOOG's revenue was derived from Russia in 2021, but the war with Ukraine is still having a material impact on business. CFO Ruth Porat stated that advertising spending slowed in Europe, particularly on YouTube, as the war continued to escalate.</li><li>We surmise that the same macroeconomic headwinds that SNAP cited last week also negatively impacted GOOG's results. Specifically, supply chain constraints, inflation, and labor shortages are causing advertisers to rein in advertising spending.</li></ul><p>Adding to the angst, Porat reminded participants last night that GOOG is lapping a tough yr/yr comparison in Q2. In fact, since the largest impact from COVID-19 was felt in 2Q20, GOOG benefited the most in 2Q21 from favorable yr/yr comparisons. This was evidenced by GOOG's total revenue soaring by 62% in 2Q21, by far its highest growth rate in recent history.<br aria-hidden="true"><br aria-hidden="true">It's not all gloom and doom, though. Google Cloud continued to post impressive growth, with revenue up 45% to $5.8 bln, as its cybersecurity offerings and Google Workspace continued to thrive. The company also authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $70 bln in Class A and Class C shares, buffering some of the disappointment from its Q1 performance. <br aria-hidden="true"><br aria-hidden="true">After GOOG issued seven straight blowout earnings reports, a sense of complacency may have set in. However, the EPS miss and in-line revenue for 1Q22 provided a reminder that even GOOG isn't immune to competitive threats or macroeconomic headwinds. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
