<html><body><p>Operating at the crossroads of two powerful trends, GPU maker<strong> NVIDIA </strong>(<strong>NVDA</strong>) has become a premier growth stock and a highly favored name within the semiconductor space. </p><ul><li>Thanks to an explosion in gaming activity during the pandemic, NVDA's gaming unit has experienced a surge in demand for its graphics chips. </li><li>At the same time, NVDA's burgeoning data center (DC) business is generating triple-digit growth as enterprises move an ever-expanding variety of content to the cloud.</li><li>This pair of catalysts, combined with its recent acquisition of Mellanox, has laid the foundation for NVDA's resurgence. </li></ul><p>Analysts have greatly underestimated the momentum underlying NVDA's business. After cruising past top and bottom-line estimates in each of the past three quarters, NVDA once again crushed expectations last night. </p><ul><li>In Q2, the company generated EPS of $2.18 (+76% yr/yr), easily surpassing the $1.68 consensus estimate, as revenue jumped by 50% to $3.87 bln vs. the 3.66 bln forecast.<ul><li>NVDA's DC segment stole the show as revenue soared by 167% to $1.75 bln, exceeding gaming revenue for the first time in the company's history. <ul><li>In mid-May, NVDA launched "A100", its new data center GPU based off the company's Ampere architecture. Strong adoption for the new chip is one key growth driver for this segment.</li><li>The integration of NVDA's $7.0 bln acquisition of Mellanox is another major factor behind the robust DC growth. Completed on April 27, the acquisition's impact was felt throughout the full quarter, contributing about 30% of DC segment sales.</li></ul></li><li>Gaming segment revenue increased by 26% yr/yr to $1.65 bln. This unit is poised to achieve much stronger growth over the remainder of 2020. <ul><li>NVDA's CFO, Colette Kress, stated that gaming revenue will likely surpass data center revenue in Q3 due to back-to-school and early holiday sales of gaming PCs and <strong>Nintendo's</strong> (<strong>NTDOY</strong>) Switch consoles.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>Fueled by accelerating gaming revenue and continued strength in DC, NVDA issued upside Q3 revenue guidance of $4.40 bln, +/- 2%, vs. the $3.97 bln expectation.&nbsp;<br><br>Despite the blow out Q2 results and upside guidance, shares of NVDA are only modestly higher today. If one wanted to nit-pick, DC sequential revenue growth of ~7%, excluding Mellanox contributions, may be disappointing to some investors. <br><br> However, the main reason why NVDA isn't substantially higher is because the stock already surged by 40% since its Q1 earnings report. Today's rather muted reaction is a function of the strong results already being priced into the stock.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
