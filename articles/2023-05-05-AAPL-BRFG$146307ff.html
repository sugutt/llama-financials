<html><body><p><strong>Apple (AAPL +5%) </strong>is trading nicely higher after reporting Q2 (Mar) results last night. The headline numbers of a nice EPS beat and upside revenue were quite good, especially in light of macro and FX headwinds. After production headaches due to China COVID shutdowns in DecQ, Apple says that supply was not a problem in MarQ. Apple also announced a $90 bln share repurchase program and hiked the dividend by 4%. </p><ul><li><strong>iPhone was the star of the show</strong> with revenue coming in much better than expected. Revenue rose 1.5% yr/yr to $51.33 bln, a record iPhone result for MarQ. Apple says iPhone 14 continues to delight users with its long-lasting battery and advanced camera. Apple said that production issues in DecQ may have pushed some sales into MarQ. iPhone outperformance helped to offset weakness in other areas. </li><li> <strong>Probably the biggest disappointment was Mac sales</strong>, which fell 31% yr/yr to $7.17 bln, which was below street estimates. In fairness, Mac was lapping a very difficult compare last year which included the incredibly successful rollout of its M1 chips throughout its Mac lineup. However, Apple also conceded that Mac faced some macroeconomic and FX headwinds. </li><li><strong>iPad revenue fell 13%</strong> yr/yr at $6.67 bln, which was in-line with street ests, Similar to Mac, iPad revenue was hurt by macro and FX challenges as well as lapping the M1-powered iPad Air last year. </li><li> <strong>Wearables revenue was flat</strong> yr/yr at $8.76 bln, which was slight upside. Wearables was up 5% to $20.9 bln, which was a bit light but not bad. </li><li> <strong>Emerging Markets was another important topic</strong> with India being described as an "incredibly exciting market" and a major focus for Apple. It just launched its first two Apple stores there, one in Mumbai and one in Delhi. CEO Tim Cook visited and saw a lot of excitement firsthand. There are a lot of people coming into the middle-class, and Apple feels that India is at a tipping point. Apple also had a stellar quarter in other emerging markets, with records set in several countries. </li></ul><p><strong>Overall, it was a solid quarter but pretty much as expected. </strong>Strong iPhone revenue helped to offset some weakness in Macs an iPads. The sizeable buyback authorization and dividend hike were a nice bonus. <strong>All eyes now turn to WWDC</strong>, Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference in early June. Excitement is building for what is expected to be the launch of Apple's AR/VR headset, which would be a new product category for Apple. The first headsets are expected to be pretty pricey with cheaper versions likely in the next couple of years. </p><p>Apple shares have been on a nice uptrend, up nearly 40% from their January lows and the stock is flirting a new 52-week high today. Suppliers to keep on note include: <strong>SWKS, CRUS, AVGO, QRVO, TSM</strong>, and <strong>QCOM</strong>, among others (<strong>SMH</strong>); <strong>SSNLF</strong>, <strong>LPL </strong>(for displays) and <strong>LITE </strong>(for FaceID).</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
