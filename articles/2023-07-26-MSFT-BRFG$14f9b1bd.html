<html><body><p><strong>Microsoft (MSFT -3%)</strong> is heading lower today after wrapping up FY23 on a mixed note. The software giant reported a solid EPS beat for Q4 (Jun) last night. However, the upside was not as large as we saw in MarQ and the Q1 (Sep) revenue guidance was a bit below analyst expectations. In our preview, we noted our caution heading into this report given the big run in the stock. </p><ul><li> Let's start with Azure, which grew +27% CC (constant currency), at the high end of the +26-27% CC prior guidance. Azure growth continues to moderate from +31% in MarQ, +38% CC in DecQ, +42% CC in SepQ and +46% CC in JunQ. That is not entirely surprising given that Azure is getting quite large. Also, we see the SepQ Azure guidance of +25-26% CC as pretty solid and not much of a drop off from JunQ. </li><li>MSFT said on its call that Azure continues to take share as customers migrate their existing workloads and invest in new ones. Also, of note, Microsoft Cloud surpassed $110 bln in annual revenue in FY23 with Azure accounting for more than 50% of the total for the first time. Another positive was that we did not hear MSFT repeat its cautious comments from its MarQ call when it said Azure customers continued to exercise some caution. Overall, Azure looked quite strong. </li><li>MSFT saw continued healthy renewal strength in its commercial business, which includes its upsell and attach motions, particularly with Microsoft 365 E5. MSFT saw a record number of $10+ mln contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365. Also, the average annualized value for its large long-term Azure contracts was the highest it's ever been. Commercial RPO increased +18% CC to $224 bln and roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months. </li><li>In its consumer business, the PC market overall was in-line with expectations, although the early timing of back-to-school inventory builds benefited Windows OEM. Advertising spend was slightly lower than anticipated, which impacted search and news advertising and LinkedIn Marketing. As previously announced, Microsoft is in the process of acquiring <strong>Activision Blizzard (ATVI)</strong>. MSFT said it continues to work through the regulatory approval process and remains confident about getting the deal done. </li></ul><p> Overall, this was a solid but not spectacular end to FY23. MSFT does not usually guide lower for the next quarter, so that was a bit troublesome. It gave a reason for investors to lock in some of the 40% gain they had seen since early March. We had cautioned in our preview that, given the recent run, we would use caution. However, even with today's pullback, the stock performance has been very impressive, so we would not worry too much about today. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
