<html><body><p><strong>Alphabet's (GOOG)</strong> Google segment appears to be searching for the right balance between selling targeted ads and maintaining user privacy. Today's announcement that the company will not use alternate identifiers to track user browsing following the phase-out of third-party cookies pulls Google toward the privacy side of the spectrum, which has the potential to really shake up the digital ad space. </p><ul><li> Last year, Chrome announced its intent to remove support for third-party cookies, and it has been working with the broader industry on the Privacy Sandbox to come up with ideas to "protect anonymity while still delivering results for advertisers and publishers", per a <a bhref="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/a-more-privacy-first-web/" target="_blank">statement on the company's blog</a>. Google says that it has continued to field questions regarding whether it will join other ad tech industry players in plans to replace third-party cookies with alternative user-level identifiers. </li><li> Today, Google has stated explicitly that after third-party cookies are phased out, Google "will not build alternate identifiers to track individuals as they browse across the web", and neither does Google intend to use them in its products. Instead, the company's web products will be "powered by privacy-preserving APIs which prevent individual tracking while still delivering results for advertisers and publishers". </li><li>Google is not the only one moving more toward increased privacy protections. <strong>Apple (AAPL)</strong> plans to roll out a key update in its upcoming iOS 14 that requires an opt-in to give apps permission to track people's activity across other apps and the web. Not surprisingly, <strong>Facebook (FB) </strong>is furious about this, as it makes most of its money from targeted ads.</li></ul><p>Google is just one company, but its massive size could really help push the digital ad industry toward the privacy direction. The ripple effect goes beyond search. It is likely to affect lots of digital publishers and marketers.</p><p>For example, <strong>The Trade Desk (TTD -8%)</strong>, which operates a cloud-based advertising-buying platform, is sharply lower today. <strong>Magnite (MGNI -6%)</strong>, a sell-side advertising platform, is also sharply lower. Digital ads are not going anywhere, but there is the potential that they will become less valuable over time if individual browsing behavior is not being tracked. We also think it's likely that a stronger push back on consumer tracking will affect other areas over time, like credit card purchases, which could hurt companies like <strong>Cardlytics (CDLX -3%)</strong>.</p><p> In sum, it looks like growing demand for consumer privacy is winning out with tech titans, and this is likely to re-shape the digital ad industry over the coming years. Also, it's likely just a matter of time before the industry faces a more stringent regulatory environment, as both sides of the political aisle are advocating for enhanced consumer privacy.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
