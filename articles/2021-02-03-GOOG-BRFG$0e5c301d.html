<html><body>This earnings season has featured plenty of solid performances so far, including impressive results from <strong>Apple</strong> (<strong>AAPL</strong>), <strong>Microsoft</strong> (<strong>MSFT</strong>), and <strong>Facebook</strong> (FB), among others. The report that stands above the rest, though, belongs to Google parent <strong>Alphabet</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>), which posted jaw-dropping 4Q20 numbers after the close yesterday.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Following FB's blowout report, which was fueled by a sharp acceleration in advertising spending, market participants certainly had an inkling that GOOG would exceed analysts' estimates. However, few expected the company to crush EPS forecasts by its largest margin in over five years ($22.30 vs. $15.98), with revenue growth ramping to 23.5% compared to the expectation of 13% growth.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">It takes a few different factors to beat estimates in such convincing fashion. For GOOG, the most prominent determinant is that advertising revenue has recovered at a much faster-than-anticipated pace. Rewinding to 2Q20, advertising revenue dropped by 8% as the pandemic caused businesses to rein in marketing expenses. During that earnings conference call, CEO Sundar Pichai struck a cautious tone, stating that the global economic environment remained fragile and that the outlook was uncertain due to the pandemic.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Last quarter, advertising budgets began to loosen as economies reopened. In GOOG's core search business (~55% of revenue), revenue climbed by 6.5%, driven by improvements in advertising spending across most verticals. This stabilization and recovery have quickly transitioned to a robust upswing, especially in the direct-response ad category.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In total, advertising revenue jumped by 22% in Q4 to $46.2 bln, highlighted by a 47% surge in YouTube revenue to $6.9 bln. Like FB, GOOG is benefiting from the powerful secular trend of consumers moving more activity online, including shopping and buying. In turn, businesses are pouring more marketing dollars into digital channels.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">While the GOOG Services segment (Search, YouTube Ads) experienced a major revival in growth, Google Cloud continued its rapid expansion. For the quarter, cloud revenue increased by 46% to $3.83 bln, with the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) generating growth that was significantly above cloud overall. GCP is a suite of cloud computing services that provides infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and server-less computing environments.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For the first time, GOOG broke out additional financial data for the cloud segment. Notably, the company disclosed that the business isn't profitable despite the high growth rate, posting an operating loss of $1.24 bln for the quarter. The company is still heavily investing in its cloud business and has tripled the size of its sales force, so the lack of profitability isn't overly surprising or concerning. Over time, GOOG expects cloud's operating margin to improve as it benefits from increased scale.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Lastly, total operating expenses declined by 4% yr/yr due to lower R&amp;D spending and from cutbacks GOOG made at the onset of the pandemic. In particular, the company slowed headcount growth last spring as the economy weakened. GOOG maintained this conservative spending approach in Q4 despite the much-improved business climate, creating another significant bottom-line driver.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">GOOG was facing lofty expectations heading into its Q4 report, illustrated by the stock's 10% year-to-date rally ahead of the print. The company delivered and surpassed even the most bullish of expectations, providing the catalyst to push shares to new all-time highs.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
