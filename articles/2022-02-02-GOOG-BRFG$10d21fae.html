<html><body><p>Any concern that Omicron and its impact on supply chains, labor markets, and the travel industry would slow <strong>Alphabet's</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>) momentum was put to rest last night after the company crushed 4Q21 EPS and revenue estimates. There was no letup in the strong advertising spending that has defined GOOG's recent run of blowout reports, which now stands at seven straight quarters. Strength was broad-based once again with retail particularly standing out, leading the way to a 32% increase in advertising revenue to $61.2 bln.<br aria-hidden="true"><br aria-hidden="true">The robust digital advertising market that spurred GOOG's remarkable performance sets the stage for solid showings from <strong>Meta Platforms</strong> (<strong>FB</strong>) after the close today and from <strong>Snap</strong> (<strong>SNAP</strong>) and <strong>Pinterest</strong> (<strong>PINS</strong>) tomorrow evening. Compared to GOOG, those social media companies have been affected more severely by <strong>Apple's </strong>(<strong>AAPL</strong>) iOS privacy changes. However, encouragingly, YouTube -- the only GOOG platform that was modestly impacted by the iOS changes in Q3 -- didn't appear to be materially hit this quarter. After direct response advertising revenue slipped a bit last quarter, CFO Ruth Porat noted during yesterday's earnings conference call that YouTube's 25% jump in Q4 advertising revenue was driven by strength in both brand and direct response advertising.<br aria-hidden="true"><br aria-hidden="true">Accounting for 85% of Q4 revenue, GOOG's advertising business is front-and-center, but it doesn't tell the full story of the quarter. Other key items include:</p><ul><li>Led by the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Google Cloud generated revenue growth of 45%. Google Workspace is one platform service that continues to draw high demand due to remote work trends. In Q4, the application experienced significant growth in both seats and average revenue per seat.<ul><li>As GOOG ramps up its investments in Cloud, the segment's operating losses widened to $(890) mln from $(644) mln last quarter. However, this isn't overly concerning for investors since the focal point is on growth and capturing market share.</li></ul></li><li>Other revenues climbed by 22% to $8.2 bln due to the successful launch of the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro mobile phones. In fact, GOOG set a quarterly sales record for Pixel, despite facing significant supply chain challenges.</li><li>The cherry on top is that GOOG also announced a 20-for-1 stock split that it believes will make its stock more accessible to a wider range of investors. It's also plausible that the stock split is intended to make GOOG a more realistic option to be added to the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average sometime down the road.</li></ul><p>Expectations were high heading into GOOG's Q4 report, and the company delivered once again. The internet giant is simply an advertising juggernaut that's capable of overcoming significant macro-related headwinds. Its impressive results provide a bullish data point for FB, SNAP, PINS, and TWTR -- but they also set a high bar for those companies to hurdle. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
