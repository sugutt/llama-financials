<html><body><p><strong>Apple (AAPL +4%)</strong> is splitting higher today on the first day following its 4-for-1 stock split. It seems investors like the lower stock price, and that sentiment is giving the stock a nice boost today. </p><p>A stock split should not matter to investors, as valuation and EPS are always done on a per share basis. However, it ultimately does matter to many investors who psychologically would rather own a $125 stock rather than a $500 stock. Plus, the lower price makes Apple more accessible to retail investors who purchase fewer shares. This was Apple's fifth stock split since going public and its first since a 7-for-1 split in June 2014. </p><p>Of course, the stock split has not been all that's going on with Apple of late. Apple also recently passed the $2 trillion market cap barrier, and investors keep pushing the stock to ever-higher levels. Also, just a few weeks ago, Apple reported its largest EPS beat in the past five years. The halo effect around this stock continues. </p><p>With the split now in the books, we think investors are going to be looking forward to the upcoming launch of the iPhone 12. Apple normally launches its new iPhones in September, but the pandemic caused some disruption in the supply chain, so this year's launch will probably take place in October.  </p><p>This year's iPhone launch will be a bigger deal than most years. Apple typically improves the processor and camera of its model every year. But the 2020 product will be the first 5G phone that Apple offers, so the upgrade cycle this year is expected to be more robust than normal. We think the excitement around the 5G launch has been helping to propel the stock higher.</p><p> Overall, it seems that every investor wants a piece of Apple, and they do not seem put off by the $2+ trillion price tag and $130 stock price (which actually sounds pretty cheap now post-split). With the debut of a 5G iPhone around the corner, excitement is likely to remain high around this stock in the coming weeks. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
