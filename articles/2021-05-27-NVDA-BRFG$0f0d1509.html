<html><body>There are few certainties in the stock market, but it was nearly a given that <strong>NVIDIA</strong> (<strong>NVDA</strong>) would post strong Q1 results last night that topped analysts' expectations. The only real question was whether NVDA would crush the consensus estimates, like it has in the two preceding quarters, or, whether analysts' have significantly narrowed the gap between their expectations and NVDA's actual results. By exceeding the EPS forecast by $0.38 ($3.66 vs. $3.28), the answer lies somewhere in between as NVDA still comfortably outperformed projections, but not as impressively as the remarkable $1.12 and $0.99 beats it registered in Q4 and Q3.<br><br>With the stock up 80% yr/yr, resulting in a frothy 1-year forward P/E of 44x, the more down-to-earth performance is one reason why shares aren't reacting more favorably. Another reason, though, is that there's some concern that demand from cryptocurrency miners for its gaming chips is inflating its growth. During the earnings call last night, CFO Colette Kress commented, "We believe gaming also benefited from crypto mining demand, although it's hard to determine to what extent."<br><br>This is a potential issue because crypto-related demand can be fleeting due to the highly volatile nature of the crypto market. In 2018, when the crypto market tumbled, NVDA faced a severe supply and demand imbalance for its gaming chips as crypto miners vanished. To prevent a similar scenario from unfolding again, NVDA launched a new line of crypto currency mining processors (CMPs), while also limiting the mining ability of its gaming chips.<br><br>Sales of its CMPs came in at $155 mln in Q1, but NVDA was unable to peg the amount of crypto-related sales of gaming chips. <br><br>However, with revenue surging by 106% yr/yr to $2.76 bln, it's clear that business is booming with or without the cryptocurrency impact. From a broader viewpoint, the rising popularity of gaming that emerged during the pandemic continues to provide a potent tailwind. More specific to NVDA, the company's line of RTX graphics cards is red-hot and are being embedded into a rapidly increasing number of laptops.  In fact, over 140 laptops on the market are now powered by NVDA's second-generation RTX graphics.<br><br>Meanwhile, NVDA's burgeoning Data Center (DC) segment continues to shine with revenue up 79% yr/yr to a quarterly record of $2.05 bln. Kress highlighted strength from hyperscale customers as a key source of growth as they continue to build out infrastructure to commercialize artificial intelligence (AI) opportunities. Additionally, its A100 chip is experiencing healthy demand from cloud providers, including <strong>Google</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>), which are using the technology for varying areas of AI, such as language understanding/processing and recommendation systems.<br><br>There's little evidence that a slowdown for NVDA is on the horizon, illustrated by its upside Q2 revenue guidance of $6.174-$6.426 bln (+63% at midpoint) vs. the $5.48 bln consensus estimate. Kress did acknowledge that NVDA expects to remain supply constrained into 2H21, but the company seems to be navigating around the component shortages effectively. Looking beyond the next couple of quarters, the automotive segment is poised to become the next major catalyst. Although this business only generated revenue of $154 mln this quarter, Kress noted that its automotive design win pipeline now exceeds $8 bln through fiscal 2027.<br><br>While it may not be reflected in the stock today, NVDA's performance and outlook demonstrated once again why it's considered to be a top-flight growth name in the semiconductor space. The cryptocurrency concern is viable, but not overly worrying in our view because the company's growth would remain stellar even if the crypto market crashed.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
