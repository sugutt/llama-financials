<html><body><p>After <strong>NVIDIA's (NVDA -8%)</strong> main competitor, <strong>Advanced Micro (AMD -3%)</strong>, topped DecQ estimates handily on robust data center growth, the bar was set high for NVDA, which derives over $1 bln more in quarterly data center revs than AMD. As a result, even though NVDA posted a double-digit adjusted EPS beat, robust Q4 (Jan) sales growth, and upbeat Q1 (Apr) guidance, investors expected more, especially given NVDA's lofty 47x FY22 earnings multiple. </p><p>Also, NVDA predicted that non-GAAP gross margins will be around 67% in Q1 (Apr), the same as in the past two quarters, translating to just 80 bps of improvement yr/yr. Those would still be excellent margins, especially compared to the performance of AMD, which boasts around 50% gross margins, and <strong>Intel (INTC)</strong>, whose margins of 55% have contracted steadily over the past year as new technology development ramps. However, that result will not ignite the kind of excitement amongst investors needed to put NVDA shares, which are now down roughly 14% YTD, back on the right track. </p><p> <strong>Still, NVDA had plenty of highlights in Q4 that demonstrate how well-positioned the company is to sustain its current momentum.</strong></p><ul><li>  Starting with NVDA's bottom and top lines in Q4, it beat earnings estimates for the 13th consecutive quarter and grew revs 52.8% yr/yr to $7.64 bln, surpassing the company's prior Q4 guidance and topping consensus. </li><li> Impressively, NVDA's revenue has climbed by over 38% yr/yr each quarter for over two straight years now. This largely results from accelerated demand in data center GPUs, which process complex computations exponentially faster than CPUs. As digitalization has exploded since the start of the pandemic, more and more companies are searching for data insights, building models, and performing other compute-intensive workloads. </li><li> This has paved the way for NVDA to become the leader in supplying GPUs for data center use, as highlighted by the division's 71% jump yr/yr and its 11% increase sequentially in Q4 to $3.26 bln. To put the demand for data center GPUs into perspective, INTC, the leader in supplying CPUs for data center use, grew that segment's sales by just 20% yr/yr in DecQ, despite lapping growth of just 11% in the year-ago period. Meanwhile, NVDA lapped a 97% growth rate from the year-ago period. </li><li>Other segments also grew nicely in the quarter. Gaming revs showed solid growth of 37% yr/yr to $3.42 bln, driven by ongoing demand for NVDA's RTX GPU line. Pro Visualization continued to produce huge numbers, with revs up 109% yr/yr to $643 mln. <ul><li> However, Automotive was the laggard in Q4, as revs dropped by 14% yr/yr and 7% sequentially. After the leading steel supplier for the auto industry, <strong>Cleveland Cliffs (CLF)</strong>, missed EPS estimates last week due to ongoing chip shortages, it was all but certain that NVDA's automotive segment would underperform. However, we do not think this is affecting stock price much today, as it is well understood that the automotive industry is continuing to face supply chain pressures. </li></ul></li><li>Looking ahead, NVDA's outlook is quite bullish. The company expects AprQ revs of $7.93-8.26 bln, translating to 43% growth yr/yr at the midpoint and resembling AMD's MarQ guidance. NVDA also expects accelerated growth in Data Center and Gaming revs sequentially in Q1.</li></ul><p> <strong>Bottom line, although it is not showing up in the stock price today, NVDA put up excellent numbers in Q4</strong>, driven by continued momentum in its Data Center and Gaming businesses. <strong>However, we think investors just expected more</strong>, especially given the current environment of rising interest rates, which puts heightened pressure on companies that trade with rich valuations, like NVDA, to outperform. Nonetheless, we think NVDA is an excellent choice for long-term investors given its market leadership in data center and gaming GPUs, along with the increasing potential in its Pro Visualization and Automotive segments.  </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
