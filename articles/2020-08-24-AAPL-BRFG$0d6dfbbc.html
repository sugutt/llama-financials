<html><body><p><strong>Apple (AAPL)</strong> is tasting really good to investors today as the market pushes the tech giant past $500 for the first time ever today. Apple also recently passed the $2 trillion market cap barrier but investors keep pushing the stock to ever-higher levels. It's been a few weeks since Apple reported its largest EPS beat in the past five years and a 4-for-1 stock split but the halo effect around this stock continues. </p><p>Here's why the stock is up so much today:</p><ul><li> Morgan Stanley increased its price target on Apple today to $520 from $431. <ul><li> This is important not only because it's a tier-one firm doing it, which carries extra weight, but also because $520 marks a Street-high number, beating out Wedbush's $515 target increase from a couple of weeks ago.  </li><li>This increase also comes just weeks after Morgan Stanley upped its target to $431 from $419 on July 31, which speaks to the rapid rise the stock has seen since its JunQ numbers were released. </li></ul></li><li> Today is the "of record" date for the Apple stock split, meaning that investors who own the stock at the close today will get three more shares a week from today. <ul><li> It functionally does not really matter even if you buy the stock later in the week, but some investors prefer buying before the record date. </li></ul></li><li> There is also excitement that the stock is a week away from trading on a post-split basis. </li><li> Excitement may also be building as we are likely just a couple of months away from Apple unveiling its first 5G iPhone, which we expect will fuel a massive upgrade cycle. </li><li>The stock is also probably getting a boost on progress on the virus as the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization for use of blood plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients as a treatment for the coronavirus. </li></ul><p> Overall, it seems every investor wants a piece of Apple and they do not seem put off by the $2 trillion price tag and $500 stock price barrier. Looking ahead, with Apple already near Morgan Stanley's Street-high price target, we suspect other firms will be raising their targets in the near term. Maybe we'll get a $600 target soon or analysts may wait until after the stock split to raise their price targets. The bigger takeaway here is that with big sell side firms raising targets and with a 5G iPhone around the corner, excitement is likely to remain high around this stock in the coming months.  </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
