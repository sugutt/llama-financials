<html><body><p><strong>Meta Platforms'</strong> (<strong>FB</strong>) transformation into a pioneering metaverse developer has been anything but smooth, and quantifying any tangible progress in its efforts has been difficult. Last night, though, a key component of FB's metaverse ambitions was revealed when the <em>Financial Times</em><strong> </strong>reported that the company is developing virtual coins and creator coins. Unlike cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or ethereum, these coins probably won't be backed by blockchain technology and will likely be used exclusively within the FB metaverse. In other words, FB would be taking a page out of <strong>Roblox's</strong> (<strong>RBLX</strong>) playbook, which generates revenue by selling "Robux" to its users.<br aria-hidden="true"><br aria-hidden="true">Although RBLX is currently struggling through a rough patch -- as evidenced by the 65% plunge that the stock has taken since last December -- it has an impressive track record of growth. Despite lapping a pandemic-fueled FY20 in which bookings surged by 171%, bookings still jumped by 45% in FY21 to $2.73 bln. Profitability has remained elusive for RBLX, but its main priority at this point hinges on expanding its user base and improving its platform. Overall, RBLX's success and popularity is an encouraging sign for FB.<br aria-hidden="true"><br aria-hidden="true">However, the path ahead will remain bumpy for a variety of reasons.</p><ul><li>For all the attention that FB's metaverse plans receive, the company will heavily rely on its Family of Apps (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger) business for the foreseeable future. Advertising on these platforms accounts for 97% of total revenue, which amounted to nearly $118 bln in FY21. Any material shift in FB's revenue mix could take years to play out.<ul><li>Therefore, the well-documented headwinds that are impacting FB, including <strong>Apple's</strong> (<strong>AAPL</strong>) iOS changes and rising competition from TikTok and <strong>Snap</strong> (<strong>SNAP</strong>), are likely to remain an issue throughout FY22.</li></ul></li><li>Simultaneously, FB is sinking billions worth of capital into data centers, AI, network infrastructure, and a workforce to support the buildout of the metaverse. This year alone, the company is planning on capital expenditures of $19-32 bln, creating further pressure on profitability.</li><li>Regulatory risks continue to build, as evidenced by the recent announcement of a new joint investigation by the European Commission and the U.K. Competition Market Authority. The agencies are looking into possible antitrust activity between FB and <strong>Google</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>) related to an agreement the companies made that may have limited competition on GOOG's Open Bidding platform.</li><li>As FB navigates through this gauntlet of challenges, positive happenings like today's news should help improve sentiment. For instance, the company may soon announce the integration of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Facebook, allowing users to post, share, and mint NFTs.<ul><li>CEO Mark Zuckerberg also stated during the Q4 earnings conference call that a new version of the Horizon software will be launched this year. This will extend the metaverse beyond virtual reality hardware, such as FB's Quest 2 set, making experiences and worlds available on the Facebook and Instagram apps.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Receiving some clarity on FB's monetization plans for the metaverse is a welcome development. Following in the footsteps of RBLX by using centrally controlled virtual coins also seems like the most logical, straight-forward avenue that FB can take. While the longer-term vision is becoming a bit clearer, FB is still facing a few obstacles in its core advertising business that could continue to weigh on its results throughout the year.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
