<html><body><p>On a relatively light day for news and earnings, <strong>Apple's</strong> (<strong>AAPL</strong>) notable strength is a primary story as the tech bellwether steers the Nasdaq's outperformance. Gains for mega-cap stocks like AAPL, <strong>Microsoft</strong> (<strong>MSFT</strong>), and&nbsp;<strong>Amazon</strong> (<strong>AMZN</strong>) certainly isn't breaking news as an unrelenting bullish bias has catapulted these names higher for quite some time. However, there's more behind AAPL's rally today than just the typical enthusiasm and positive sentiment that surrounds the name.</p><ul><li>AAPL is poised to report 1Q21 after the close on Wednesday and investors are positioning themselves for a strong performance. Following strong quarterly reports from semiconductor suppliers <strong>Micron</strong> (<strong>MU</strong>) and <strong>Taiwan Semi</strong> (<strong>TSM</strong>)  earlier this month, there is good reason for investors to feel optimistic about AAPL's prospects.<ul><li>Recall that supply chain disruptions caused AAPL to delay the launch of its 5G-enabled iPhone 12 until late October. Consequently, certain chip makers didn't experience the typical seasonal jump in demand in Q3 to support the launch.&nbsp;</li><li>This demand, which funneled into Q4 and 1Q21, appears to be especially strong based on MU's and TSM's beat-and-raise quarterly reports.</li></ul></li><li>Highly-regarded Wedbush analyst Dan Ives raised his price target for AAPL to $175 from $160 two days prior to the earnings report. Anticipation that the iPhone 12 super-cycle has come to fruition, leading to comfortable EPS and revenue beats, is the main impetus for Ives' bullish call.<ul><li>The street-high price target, which sits 23% above the current price, is noteworthy, but it's more the timing of the call that stands out. To take such a bullish stance just two days before the earnings report speaks to Ives' high level of confidence in AAPL.</li></ul></li><li>There's also a technical component in play as the stock pushes through resistance in the $138-$140 area to break out to new all-time highs.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Expectations are running hot heading into AAPL's highly-anticipated report as evidence points to a strong showing from the country's largest company. A continued run higher into the print raises the risk of a sell-the-news reaction, but AAPL's status as one of the most beloved stocks only seems to be growing following the iPhone 12 launch and its entrance into 5G.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
