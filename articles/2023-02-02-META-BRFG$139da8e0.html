<html><body><p>Three months ago, <strong>Meta Platforms</strong> (<strong>META</strong>) was trading at its lowest levels in about seven years as Mark Zuckerberg's metaverse aspirations and the associated spending spree to support that buildout caused investors to leave the stock in droves. Just as it seemed META completely lost its way by shunning the bread-and-butter social media/digital advertising business that made it a must-own stock, the company began a game-changing pivot last November that has lit a fire under its shares. That pivot to rein in costs, while refocusing on what has made META so successful in the past -- namely, its Family of Apps business -- was on display last night when the company issued its 4Q22 earnings report.</p><ul><li>On November 9, META reaffirmed its Q4 revenue guidance of $30.0-$32.5 bln, but that wasn't the main story. Instead, the focal point rested on META's reduced FY23 operating expense guidance of $94-$100 bln, which was made possible by its simultaneous announcement of a workforce reduction of 11,000 positions. </li><li>It was only two weeks earlier that the stock was pummeled by nearly 25% in the wake of a Q3 earnings miss and a FY23 forecast that called for operating expenses to jump by about 15% to $96-$101 bln. Furthermore, META's capex outlook of $34-$39 bln represented a 12% increase at the midpoint, signaling that Zuckerberg had no intention of scaling back his metaverse investments, even as concerns of a looming recession intensified.</li><li>Following a 64% nosedive for the stock in 2022, the post-Q3 earnings report collapse was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back for Zuckerberg. Suddenly, 2023 is now the "year of efficiency", according to Zuckerberg, with the CEO aiming to slash even more costs this year. </li><li>One key catalyst for the stock's meteoric rise today is the further reduction in FY23 total expense guidance to $89-$95 bln, and the reduced capex forecast to $30-$33 bln. Perhaps as important as the capex cut itself is the disclosure that META expects nearly all of its expenditures to support the Family of Apps segment, rather than the loss-generating Reality Labs (metaverse) segment. On that note, Family of Apps posted Q4 operating income of $10.7 bln, compared to an operating loss of ($4.3) for Reality Labs.</li><li>The change of heart from Zuckerberg has ignited a dramatic turnaround. Since the November 9 update, the stock has soared by an incredible 80%, despite the fact that revenue and earnings growth have both evaporated. In Q4, revenue and GAAP EPS fell by 4.5% and 52%, respectively, offering a not-so-subtle reminder that META is still facing numerous challenges.</li><li>A soft digital advertising market is at the top of that list, with competitive pressures from TikTok, and <strong>Apple's</strong> (<strong>AAPL</strong>) iOS changes from last year, also weighing on META's growth. </li><li>However, META's inline revenue guidance of $26.0-$28.5 bln, which reflects a 2.1% yr/yr increase at the high end, shows that it's faring much better than rival <strong>Snap</strong> (<strong>SNAP</strong>). Recall that on Tuesday night, SNAP noted in its Q4 earnings report that quarter-to-date revenue for 1Q23 was down by about 7%, prompting it to forecast a 2-10% drop for the quarter. It's now evident that SNAP's troubles are amplified by company-specific issues, including its decision to&nbsp;implement some changes to its direct response advertising platform that will be disruptive for its partners.</li><li>The emergence of Reels -- META's answer to TikTok's ultra-popular short-format video platform -- is another encouraging development that's fueling the stock's gains. Reels plays on Facebook and Instagram more than doubled on a yr/yr basis, and users resharing Reels more than doubled over the past six months. It will take some time for Reels monetization efficiency to catch up to the more mature apps, but META believes it can be revenue neutral by the end of the year.</li></ul><p>The main takeaway is that META's "transformation in reverse" is reawakening the company as it returns to its profitable roots. In addition to its accelerating cost-cutting measures, and its new $40 bln share buyback program, the prioritization of its cash flow generating Family of Apps segment is a signal to investors that a return to earnings growth is on the horizon.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
