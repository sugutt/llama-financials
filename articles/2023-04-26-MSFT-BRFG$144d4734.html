<html><body><p><strong>Microsoft (MSFT +7%)</strong> is sharply higher today after reporting a big EPS beat for Q3 (Mar) last night. In fact, this was MSFT's largest EPS beat in the past eight quarters and it guided Q4 (Jun) revs in-line. In our preview, we noted our caution heading into this report and we think many investors shared our concerns. However, MSFT came through with impressive results. </p><ul><li> <strong>Let's start with Azure</strong>, which grew +27%, but +31% constant currency (CC), generally in-line with the low-30s CC prior guidance and we would argue better than feared given all the macro headwinds. Azure growth continues to slow from +38% CC in DecQ, +42% CC in SepQ and +46% CC in JunQ. MSFT then guided to +26-27% CC in JunQ but we think that guidance was better than feared. </li><li> MSFT saying that Azure took market share was encouraging to hear. Also, it said Unilever went all-in on Azure in MarQ in one of the largest ever cloud migrations in the consumer goods industry. However, it was not all good news as MSFT noted that Azure customers continued to exercise some caution as optimization and new workload trends from the prior quarter continued as expected. </li><li>Moving beyond Azure, <strong>Teams usage</strong> is at an all-time high and surpassed 300 mln monthly active users this quarter. LinkedIn saw record engagement. Gaming set MarQ records for monthly active users and monthly active devices.</li><li> <strong>Commercial revenue </strong>was up 19% CC. MSFT saw better-than-expected renewal strength, including across Microsoft 365, which also benefited Windows Commercial. PC demand was a bit better than expected, particularly in the Commercial segment, which benefited Windows OEM and Surface, even as channel inventory levels remain elevated. Advertising spend landed in line with expectations. MSFT has seen share gains in Azure, Dynamics, Teams, Security, Edge, and Bing. </li><li>There was more news besides earnings today. Microsoft is in the process of acquiring <strong>Activision Blizzard (ATVI)</strong>, but that transaction hit a snag today as the UK CMA said it will block the deal because the combination would weaken competitiveness in the cloud gaming market. ATVI said it will appeal, but CNBC's David Faber says the likelihood of success is "very slim." We think this could jeopardize the deal or potentially change it substantially if divestitures are required. </li></ul><p>Overall, this was an impressive report for Microsoft and shows that our concerns were perhaps overblown. We also think that this report, coupled with a strong <strong>Alphabet (GOOG) </strong>report, could reset some of the negativity we have seen in recent weeks around the mega cap tech space. We think these reports bode well for <strong>Meta Platforms (META)</strong>, which reports tonight and <strong>Amazon (AMZN)</strong>, which reports tomorrow after the close.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
