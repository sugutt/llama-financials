<html><body>Apple's (<strong>AAPL</strong>) losses are taking a bite out of the stock market today as ongoing production issues at Foxconn's manufacturing plant in China continue to impact iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max shipments. According to the South China Morning Post (SCMP), wait times for these higher-end iPhone models have extended to 5-6 weeks, which is two weeks longer than typical wait times seen in October. Coinciding with this news are reports that COVID-19 cases are rising again in China, including in Beijing where Chinese authorities are asking residents to stay home.&nbsp;<br><br>The Foxconn plant, located in Zhengzhou, China, is grappling with high employee turnover due to COVID-19 outbreaks, causing the facility to operate at significantly reduced capacity. However, this is nothing new, so the SCMP article doesn't come as a major surprise. When AAPL reported earnings on October 27, CEO Tim Cook commented that the lower-than-expected Q4 iPhone sales were a result of production issues. Cook added that the supply chain issues could last "a little while longer."<br><br>Then, a couple weeks later, AAPL confirmed that the Foxconn facility was still contending with virus outbreaks. Consequently, AAPL said it was expecting lower iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max shipments than it previously anticipated as wait times get pushed out.<br><br>These production delays are discouraging, but there are a couple important items to keep in mind.<br><ul><li>First and foremost, demand for iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max is strong and last quarter's sales shortfall was completely attributable to production constraints. With these issues continuing, iPhone estimates are coming down again for 1Q23, setting up for a potentially lackluster quarter. However, most of the delayed shipments should be recouped in the seasonally slower Q2 as AAPL's loyal customers wait it out.<ul><li>Additionally, it's worth noting that wait times for iPhone 14 base models haven't changed.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Despite missing analysts' Q4 iPhone estimates, AAPL still beat earnings expectations. The EPS beat was in part fueled by record Q4 gross margin of 42.3%, which came in towards the high end of AAPL's guidance of 41.5-42.5%. A similar scenario could play out in Q1 as higher average selling prices for AAPL's products buoy margins.</li></ul><p>Considering that Foxconn produces as much as 70% of AAPL's iPhones, the persistent capacity constraints there are a significant ordeal. As frustrating as the situation is, though, Foxconn's production issues don't change the fact that demand for iPhone 14 is robust and that most of those delayed shipments will eventually translate to the top-line.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
