<html><body>In the aftermath of the massive cyber-attack that targeted <strong>SolarWinds'</strong> (<strong>SWI</strong>) Orion networking management software last year, another monumental IT security event is unfolding at <strong>Microsoft</strong> (<strong>MSFT</strong>). Last Friday, IT security site <em>KrebsOnSecurity </em>reported that a Chinese hacking group called "Hafnium" allegedly exploited vulnerabilities in MSFT's Exchange Server, potentially impacting tens of thousands of companies and organizations.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">According to MSFT, the two hacking events are completely unrelated. Besides being attributed to different perpetrators, one key difference is that the SWI attack seemed to home in on larger enterprises and vital U.S. governmental agencies, such as the Department of Defense and the U.S. Treasury Department. While still very serious in nature, the MSFT breach is mostly impacting smaller and medium-sized businesses, as well as educational institutions, police departments, and local governments, among other groups.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">There's a logical explanation for why this hack is mostly affecting smaller organizations. The cyber criminals targeted four flaws within MSFT's Exchange Server email software, which operates Outlook-based email systems. Many smaller organizations, with more limited IT resources, are still running this email system on internal servers that may have weaker cybersecurity protections. On the other hand, many larger enterprises have transitioned to MSFT's cloud-based hosting services, which provide better safeguards.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Overall, this incident puts MSFT in a negative light, but it also makes a case for companies to move to its cloud offerings. The company's Intelligence Cloud (IC) segment, which includes Azure, Windows Server, and SQL Server, has been MSFT's standout performer. In Q4, IC revenue jumped by 34% to $16.7 bln.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In a general sense, this attack once again illustrates how IT security threats continue to increase in scope and severity. On a related note, shares of cybersecurity stocks, including <strong>Palo Alto Networks</strong> (<strong>PANW</strong>), <strong>ZScaler</strong> (<strong>ZS</strong>), <strong>Fortinet</strong> (<strong>FTNT</strong>), and <strong>FireEye</strong> (<strong>FEYE</strong>), are all trading higher on the session.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">MSFT is taking a major publicity hit today, and its stock is slightly lagging the broader market. From a fundamental and longer-term financial performance perspective, though, it's unlikely that this attack will make a major dent in the country's second largest company.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
