<html><body><p><strong>Alphabet (GOOG +2%)</strong> is enjoying a solid gap up today as a cooler-than-expected CPI report provided a jolt to the broader markets, including mega-caps. However, long after the close, an interesting story popped up last night. According to <em>CNBC</em>, Google quietly scrapped its plans to develop an AI-powered mobile chatbot application that features interactive characters, targeting Generation Z users. </p><ul><li> Although the move seems relatively minor, it highlights the hurdles tech firms must overcome to monetize large-language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Google's Bard, especially with open-source LLMs capable of performing similar tasks. To separate itself from open-source models, Google will need to rely on what it does best. This may be why Google ditched its mobile chatbot application, maintaining focus on how to maintain its edge over top rivals, like <strong>Microsoft (MSFT)</strong>, which implemented a chatbot into Bing. </li><li> Google still commands a giant lead in search engine market share, with most reports showing Google at over 90% while Bing is a distant second at around 2-3%. Still, with ChatGPT and LLMs, in general, being able to provide instant answers to user queries, Google's search dominance may be threatened, similar to how many other tech companies operating in their respective spaces have had to respond to concerns regarding LLMs potentially eating their lunch. </li><li>For example, <strong>Wix.com (WIX) </strong>addressed concerns about AI, noting that even if AI could code a fully functional e-commerce site, which is currently not possible, the site would still need to be deployed, managed, and maintained, features WIX handles. <strong>Adobe (ADBE)</strong> also comes to mind, given its portfolio of creative applications, like Photoshop. </li><li> However, firms like WIX and ADBE are not sitting idly by. Instead, they have attached AI features to their applications to maintain a competitive market position. Already taking advantage of AI long before ChatGPT launched for public use in November, WIX has AI features in place and is working on creating an AI layer acting as an assistant for users. Meanwhile, ADBE recently launched Firefly, its family of creative generative AI models, which already saw over 500 mln generations since its March launch. </li><li>These examples show how companies are packaging open-source technology, such as LLMs, into their current offerings to attract users, effectively monetizing AI. With Google already being synonymous with search and reportedly boasting over 60% share of the browser market with Chrome, it has a solid footing to monetize Bard by attracting users to search and selling the API to enterprises to integrate it into Chrome. </li></ul><p>Bottom line, after a brief stumble by Google's Bard in early February, its AI-powered chatbot has helped kindle an impressive stock run, appreciating over 35% since late February. There will likely be plenty of speedbumps Google will encounter with AI. However, given its market positioning, we think it will ultimately outcompete open-source threats and successfully monetize AI. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
