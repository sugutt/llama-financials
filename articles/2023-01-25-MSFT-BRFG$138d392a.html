<html><body><p><strong>Microsoft (MSFT -4%)</strong> initially traded +4% higher after reporting earnings last night, but turned lower during the call as reality set in. The initial pop in the stock was a little surprising because the headline numbers were not super great with a modest EPS beat and a slight miss on revs. But as we said last night, we think investors focused on Azure, which reported slight upside. Unfortunately, the stock headed lower during the call on cautious commentary and downside MarQ revenue guidance. </p><ul><li><strong>Let's start with Azure, </strong>which grew +38% constant currency (CC) in DecQ, a bit better than the +37% CC prior guidance and we would argue better than feared after a miss in SepQ. However, that was still down a good bit from +42% CC in SepQ and +46% CC in JunQ. Probably the bigger eye-opener was the MarQ guidance. MSFT exited DecQ with Azure growth in the mid-30s CC and expects a 4-5 pt decline in MarQ. We do not have a hard number guidance, but that sounds like low 30s CC. </li><li> MSFT expects its per user business for Azure to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, but it expects continued moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base. The takeaway here is we did not get the stabilization in Azure we wanted to see, so that's a concern. Also, this is not great news for <strong>Amazon's (AMZN)</strong> AWS unit, which is likely facing similar headwinds. AMZN reports next week (Feb 2). </li><li><strong>Moving beyond Azure,</strong> MSFT was pretty cautious in general. Just as customers accelerated their digital spend during the pandemic, MSFT is now seeing them optimize that spend. Organizations are exercising caution given the macro uncertainty. From a geographic perspective, MSFT noted that the US was weaker than expected. </li><li><strong>In its Consumer business,</strong> the PC market was in line with expectations, but execution challenges impacted Surface results. Ad spend declined slightly more than expected, which impacted Search and news advertising and LinkedIn. </li><li><strong>On the Commercial side,</strong> <strong>customers are exercising caution </strong>and MSFT saw results weaken through December. We never like to see a quarter end on a down note as it usually means the next quarter will be weak. Also, MSFT saw moderated consumption growth in Azure and lower-than-expected growth in new business across the standalone Office 365, EMS and Windows Commercial products that are sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. </li></ul><p> <strong>The big takeaways here</strong> are the weak guidance for MarQ and that Azure's growth moderation has not bottomed out yet, or even stabilized. Given Microsoft's immense size, this is adding to jitters about the economy in 2023 generally and rightly so. <strong>It also makes us nervous for Amazon's Q4 report next week, particularly its AWS unit. </strong>Then when you add in weakness in online ads, Surface, FX and increased caution from enterprise clients, that makes for several headwinds. Like many tech names, MSFT has seen its stock price bounce a bit in 2023, but this report/outlook is putting a damper on the tech space today. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
