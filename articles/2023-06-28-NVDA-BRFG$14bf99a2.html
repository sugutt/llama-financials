<html><body><p><strong>NVIDIA</strong> (<strong>NVDA</strong>), which became the face of an emerging AI-based boom in the semiconductor industry after delivering a spectacular beat-and-raise Q1 report last month, is the center of attention once again today. This time, however, the spotlight is shining on NVDA for an entirely different reason. </p><p>Specifically, last night, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reported that the U.S. is considering another round of restrictions on exports of AI chips to China, which accounts for about 20% of NVDA's total revenue. Rival <strong>Advanced Micro Devices</strong> (<strong>AMD</strong>) makes competing AI chips, putting the company in jeopardy of potentially taking a hit from the restrictions.</p><ul><li>On the surface, the report seems pretty troubling for NVDA, AMD, and other chip makers. After the U.S. Commerce Department imposed new licensing requirements on shipments of some of the most powerful AI chips last August, NVDA disclosed that it could lose as much as $400 mln in revenue. Now, the new restrictions being contemplated by the government are even more strict as concerns about China using AI technology to strengthen its military are growing.</li><li>NVDA was able to work around the previous restrictions by developing a less powerful chip called the A800 that doesn't require a license to sell into the Chinese market. That helps to explain how NVDA was able to crush Q1 results while issuing guidance that also blew out estimates. According to reports, even the A800 will require a license if the Commerce Department follows through with these new curbs.</li><li>Despite this seemingly concerning development, NVDA is hanging in there with modest losses, while AMD is actually trading higher. We believe the main reason why these stocks aren't getting hit harder is because there's a belief that the explosive growth of AI will continue with or without restrictions placed on China. As NVDA CEO Jensen Huang stated during the Q1 earnings call,&nbsp;companies are "racing to apply generative AI into every product, service, and business process."</li><li>In fact, during an interview on Bloomberg TV earlier today, NVDA's CFO commented that the company isn't expecting a material change to its earnings from the new restrictions. </li></ul><p>The bottom line is that demand for AI-based chips seems to be so robust around the world that NVDA and others will still achieve strong growth even if sales to China do slip.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
