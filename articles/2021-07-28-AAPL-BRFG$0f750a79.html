<html><body><p><strong>Apple (AAPL -2.5%)</strong> is very "a-peeling" today following another impressive earnings report. The headline numbers were quite good for Q3 (Jun). Apple reported a huge $0.29 EPS beat - not quite up to levels of last quarter's $0.42 upside, but still very good. Probably even more impressive was revenue jumping 36.4% yr/yr to a JunQ record of $81.43 bln, well above the $73.48 bln consensus. </p><p> Apple grew double-digits in each of its product categories. It posted an all-time record for services and JunQ records for iPhone, Mac, and Wearables, Home and Accessories. Apple also set new JunQ records in every geographic segment, recording strong double-digit growth in each one of them. iPhone sales jumped 50% yr/yr to $39.57 bln vs $33.5 bln ests; Mac sales rose 16% yr/yr to $8.24 bln vs $7.7 bln ests; iPad sales rose 12% yr/yr to $7.37 bln vs $6.4 bln ests; Wearables sales rose 36% yr/yr to $8.78 bln vs $7.8 bln ests; and, finally, Services revenue rose 33% yr/yr to $17.49 bln vs $16.7 bln ests. </p><p><strong>Key takeaways from the quarter:</strong> </p><ul><li>It is remarkable that iPhone sales were still so robust. iPhone 12 continues to sell well. We would have expected more of a lull given that iPhone 13 will likely make its debut in a few months. </li><li> iPad had its highest JunQ in nearly a decade while Mac set an all-time JunQ record. Apple has seen a great response to the new iMac and iPad Pro, both powered by the M1 chip. </li><li> Services set a new all-time revenue record as Apple continues to roll out new features and programming. Apple TV+ users are loving series like Mythic Quest and Ted Lasso. </li><li>We were disappointed that Apple continued its policy of not providing specific guidance. Blaming the pandemic is starting to feel a bit dated. Hopefully, when the new fiscal year kicks in, it will start to provide guidance again. Apple did say it expects very strong double-digit yr/yr revenue growth in Q4 (Sep), although it expects growth will be lower than JunQ's 36% growth. </li><li> Growth in SepQ is likely to be impacted by less favorable foreign exchange rates. Is services growth rate should return to a more typical level (JunQ was lapping easier pandemic comps). Apple also expects supply constraints during SepQ to be greater than those experienced during JunQ. The constraints will primarily impact iPhone and iPad. </li></ul><p><strong>Overall, this was a typically great quarter for Apple.</strong> The stock is slightly lower despite the good numbers. We think that's because the stock had run by 17% since early June, so good results were likely priced in already. Also, Apple's comments about more severe supply constraints in SepQ may be weighing on the name a bit, especially as they pertain to iPhones and iPads. The timing of the constraints relative to the likely launch of the iPhone 13 this fall is not ideal, and the constraints may also shave a few points off what's expected to be a big back-to-school season as students finally return to the classroom this fall.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
