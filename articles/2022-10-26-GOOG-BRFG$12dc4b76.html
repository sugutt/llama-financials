<html><body><p>For the first time in over five years, <strong>Alphabet</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>) has missed quarterly EPS expectations in three consecutive quarters as advertisers continue to scale back on spending. In Q3, total advertising revenue increased by a pedestrian 2.5%, while total revenue growth of just 6% marked GOOG's lowest growth rate in recent history -- excluding the 2Q20 pandemic quarter.<br class="ContentPasted0"><br class="ContentPasted0">On the one hand, the weak results aren't overly surprising in the wake of <strong>Snap's</strong> (<strong>SNAP</strong>) bleak earnings report and outlook from October 21. Recall that the social media company disclosed that advertising revenue growth decelerated further during Q3 due to macroeconomic headwinds, increased competition, and <strong>Apple's</strong> (<strong>AAPL</strong>) privacy changes. On the other hand, GOOG's business has generally held up better than SNAP's and other digital advertising dependent companies like <strong>Meta Platforms</strong> (<strong>META</strong>) and <strong>Pinterest</strong> (<strong>PINS</strong>).<br class="ContentPasted0"><br class="ContentPasted0">In fact, it can be argued that GOOG's search ad segment has benefitted from the challenges facing social media companies. Search is essentially insulated from AAPL's iOS changes, which has made targeted advertising much more difficult. Therefore, advertisers may view GOOG's dominance in search as a much safer option with a stronger return on investment. Even search, though, has succumbed to the downturn in advertising spending this quarter as revenue grew by a modest 4% to $39.5 bln, missing analysts' expectations. Unsurprisingly, mortgages, loans, and crypto were a few of the weakest areas.<br class="ContentPasted0"><br class="ContentPasted0">Search wasn't the only issue for GOOG in Q3.</p><ul><li>Another unwanted first for GOOG was that YouTube posted its first ever revenue decline, down about 2% yr/yr to $7.07 bln, missing analysts' expectations by a wide margin. A combination of macro-related pressures (inflation, rising interest rates, stronger dollar) and intensifying competition from TikTok are taking a toll on YouTube.<ul><li>The company is battling TikTok by prioritizing YouTube Shorts. During last night's earnings call, GOOG stated that Shorts has about 30 bln daily views, which is the same figure it disclosed last quarter.</li><li>Monetizing Shorts in a meaningful way is the next major step for GOOG. Early next year, the company plans to introduce revenue sharing with content creators.</li></ul></li><li>One of the more surprising items from the earnings report was that total expenses increased by nearly 18% yr/yr to $52 bln. GOOG has made it a point that it intends to slow its hiring pace, but that doesn't appear to be the case just yet as it added nearly 13,000 employees during Q3.<ul><li>With operating expense growth outpacing revenue growth by a good clip, GOOG's operating margin slid to 25% from 32% in the year-earlier quarter.</li><li>CFO Ruth Porat did note during the earnings call that Q4 headcount additions will slow to less than half of the number added in Q3.</li></ul></li><li>In the Other Revenue category (Google Play, Apps, Pixel phones), GOOG is seeing a slowdown in consumer spending, particularly on Google Play as gaming activity has decreased. For the quarter, Other Revenue inched higher by 2% to $6.9 bln.</li></ul><p>Google Cloud was a bright spot with revenue growing by 38% and operating loss improving to ($699) mln from ($858) mln last quarter. The solid growth is encouraging, illustrating that large enterprises are still investing in technology at a healthy rate, despite the macroeconomic uncertainty. Overall, though, it was a discouraging quarter that showed that even GOOG is not immune to this pullback in advertising spending.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
