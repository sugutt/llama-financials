<html><body>With each passing quarter, <strong>NVIDIA</strong> (<strong>NVDA</strong>) seems to one-up itself, posting phenomenal results that crush expectations and feature a bevy of new quarterly records. Such was the case yesterday when the GPU maker issued one of the strongest prints in its history. EPS and revenue surged by 64% and 61%, respectively, to easily surpass consensus estimates.<br><br>An impressive report was fully anticipated, however, evidenced by the ~12% rally in the stock this month. In fact, any result short of a blowout, coupled with robust 1Q21 guidance, would have been viewed as a major disappointment, causing a likely plunge in the stock.<br><br>Heading into the report, the primary concern was that the well-documented supply constraints within the semiconductor industry would prevent NVDA from fully meeting demand. Recall that during the 3Q20 earnings call, CFO Colette Kress stated that capacity constraints could hinder the company's ability to get gaming chips into consumers' hands, adding that it could take a few months for product availability to catch up with demand.<br><br>As NVDA's stellar performance indicates, supply shortages did not have a material impact on Q4 results. Kress acknowledged as much, commenting that although supply is tight, the company can meet demand and that additional supply increases are planned throughout 2021.<br><br>After the Data Center (DC) segment briefly took over the top spot in 2Q20, NVDA's core Gaming segment has reclaimed its leading position within the company. Bolstered by a spike in gaming popularity during the pandemic, the launch of new gaming consoles (PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch), and strong uptake for new GPUs, gaming revenue jumped by 67% yr/yr to $2.50 bln. In the earnings press release, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang credited the highly successful debut of its latest gaming GPUs, stating, "Demand for GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs is incredible. NVIDIA RTX has started a major upgrade cycle as gamers jump to ray tracing, DLSS and AI."<br><br>Although growth tapered off to 97% from 162% last quarter, the story in NVDA's burgeoning DC unit remains mostly unchanged. The company has risen to prominence in the data center market as the infusion of AI technologies across cloud computing providers has created a windfall for the company.<br><br>If that wasn't enough, the boom in the cryptocurrency market is providing yet another growth catalyst for NVDA. Namely, miners have gravitated towards the company's RTX 3060 gaming chip to mine for cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum. The company estimates that mining contributed $100-300 mln to Q4 revenue, but it does not want its gaming GPUs to be used for mining. When cryptocurrencies skyrocketed in 2018, miners flooded the market for NVDA's gaming GPUs, causing the company to ramp up production. When the bottom fell out of the cryptocurrency market later that year, a substantial supply glut wreaked havoc on NVDA's gaming segment.<br><br>To prevent a similar occurrence from happening, NVDA is developing a dedicated mining product called the "Cryptocurrency Mining Processor", which will be available this quarter. Upgraded versions of the chip will launch in 2Q21.<br><br>The phrase "an embarrassment of riches" comes to mind when thinking about NVDA and its current state of affairs. Of all the semiconductor producers, NVDA is best suited to capitalize on several of the most powerful secular trends, including the rise of AI technology, the ongoing transition of data to the cloud, the emergence of autonomous driving, the increasing popularity of gaming, and cryptocurrencies. Today's weakness is mainly a function of some profit-taking and ongoing consolidation following the stock's meteoric 120% yr/yr gain.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
