<html><body><p><strong>Microsoft (MSFT -7.4%)</strong> is trading lower despite reporting upside for EPS and revenue for Q1 (Sep) last night. After a very rare EPS miss in Q4 (Jun), it was nice to see MSFT return to reporting upside again. However, we think the main reasons for the weakness today is Azure coming up a bit light in SepQ and the DecQ guidance was a bit weak. MSFT also made some cautious comments on some other segments during the call. </p><ul><li> <strong>Let's start with Azure, which we think is the main reason for today's weakness. </strong>Azure grew 35% (+42% constant currency, or CC), which was a point below the +43% CC prior guidance and a decline from +46% CC in JunQ. Probably the bigger eye-opener was the DecQ guidance at just +37% CC. The declines have been driven by the continued moderation in Azure consumption growth as MSFT helps customers optimize current workloads, while they prioritize new workloads. </li><li><strong>Recall in our preview, we noted that </strong>the NY Post reported on Monday (see InPlay archive for link) that <strong>Amazon (AMZN) </strong>was freezing hiring in parts of its web services division. That made us nervous about Azure, and especially the guidance for DecQ. And that turned out to be the case. It also makes us nervous for when Amazon reports its AWS segment tomorrow after the close. </li><li><strong>Also, recall in our preview, we expressed concerns about a weakening online ad space </strong>following <strong>SNAP's</strong> disappointing results last week. Last night, MSFT noted reductions in customer advertising spend, which also weakened late in the quarter. That impacted Search and news advertising and LinkedIn. We never like to see a quarter end badly because it likely means the next quarter will be weak as well. And the timing for the weakness is not great, considering that Netflix is launching its first ad-supported subscription plan next month (powered by Microsoft). </li><li><strong>The weakness extends beyond Azure and online ads. </strong>In its consumer business, PC market demand further deteriorated in September, which impacted its Windows OEM and Surface businesses. Also, FX had a big impact on results as the US dollar strengthened. FX decreased total company revenue by 5 points. The silver lining was that the FX impact was generally in-line with the company's expectations. </li></ul><p><strong>Overall, the headline numbers were good for Microsoft,</strong> and a nice bounce back after a rare miss last quarter. However, Azure has been a stellar growth segment for MSFT, but it seems to be slowing a bit. <strong>That DecQ Azure guidance is a pretty big sequential decline (Amazon may report a similar decline for its AWS segment tomorrow, so use caution).</strong> Then when you add in weakness in online ads, PCs and FX, that makes for several headwinds. Also, the stock had been rebounding a bit since mid-October, which tells us sentiment may have been a bit too high heading into this report.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
