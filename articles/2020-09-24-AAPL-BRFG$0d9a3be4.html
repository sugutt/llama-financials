<html><body><p>After touching all-time highs in early September, tech titan <strong>Apple</strong> (<strong>AAPL</strong>) has slid lower by ~15%, putting a significant dent in the broader stock market in the process. Perhaps AAPL's weakness is attributable to profit-taking after investors became more uncomfortable with the stock's elevated valuation, which currently trades with a forward P/E of 27x.<br><br>However, there could be other factors at play that are contributing to AAPL's pull-back.</p><ul><li>Momentum for legal and regulatory action against AAPL from third party content providers is building. This morning, <a bhref="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-24/spotify-match-launch-coalition-to-protest-app-store-rules?sref=QY7kFAuy" target="_blank"><em>Bloomberg</em> reported</a> that <strong>Spotify</strong> (<strong>SPOT</strong>) and <strong>Match Group</strong> (<strong>MTCH</strong>) have joined a group to challenge AAPL's App Store practices.<ul><li>The complaint specifically centers on the 15-30% commission that AAPL charges when users make purchases using the in-app payment service.</li><li>Today's news comes on the heels of Epic Games filing a lawsuit against AAPL in August. The developer of the ultra-popular <em>Fortnite</em> game alleged that AAPL is violating anti-trust laws.<ul><li>Epic Games circumvented AAPL's payment system by offering a direct payment option, allowing users to purchase its gaming currency, "V-bucks", at a discount.</li><li>AAPL hit back by removing Fortnite from its App Store and filed its own suit against Epic Games for breach of contract.</li></ul></li><li>AAPL, and other tech giants such as <strong>Amazon</strong> (<strong>AMZN</strong>) and <strong>Google</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>), are also facing anti-trust scrutiny from the U.S. government. While The House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed documents from these companies, it doesn't appear that the government is ready to take legal action any time soon.<ul><li>Therefore, companies are turning to each other to combat what they believe are unfair practices.</li></ul></li><li>There is plenty at stake financially. AAPL recently disclosed that its App Store was responsible for $519 bln in sales of physical goods, services, and digital items in 2019.<ul><li>Of this amount, about $61 bln was attributed to sales of digital goods, in which AAPL receives a 15-30% cut. This pencils out to as much as $18 bln in revenue for AAPL.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>AAPL's slide also comes ahead of its delayed iPhone launch. The company typically launches new iPhone versions in September, but production delays due to COVID-19 have pushed the launch out until October.<ul><li>The latest iPhone iteration will be 5G-enabled. There is some concern, though, that consumers will hold off on replacing their current phones until 5G coverage is more expansive.</li><li>AAPL originally forecasted that iPhone sales would surpass 100 mln this year, but that outlook was prior to the pandemic. <ul><li>On August 30, <em>DigiTimes Research</em> reported that it expects iPhone sales of 63-68 mln in 2H20, which would be about 5 mln less that the number of iPhone 11 devices shipped last year.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>How the litigation plays out against AAPL is uncertain. A change to the company's commission structure could have a material financial impact on its App Store business, which is why AAPL is taking these legal challenges seriously. In the big picture, though, the lawsuits don't represent a major threat to AAPL, which currently sports a market cap of $1.87 trillion.<br><br>While litigation has more of a souring effect on sentiment, uncertainty about whether the upcoming iPhone launch will meet expectations has a much greater financial component to it. When combined with some profit-taking and valuation concerns, these two issues helped create a recipe for a pull-back for the largest stock in the market.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
