<html><body><p>The positive vibes that spilled over from <strong>Meta Platforms'</strong> (<strong>META</strong>) better-than-feared earnings report faded for Google parent <strong>Alphabet</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>) after the company posted its fourth consecutive EPS miss last night. GOOG's Q4 earnings shortfall was accompanied by yr/yr revenue decreases of 1.6% and 7.8% in its Search and YouTube businesses, respectively. In fact, excluding the pandemic-impacted quarter of 2Q20, this was the first quarter in GOOG's history that its total advertising revenue declined on a yr/yr basis, dipping by 3.6% to $59.0 bln. While META's results provided some relief, GOOG's results are offering a stark reminder that digital advertising dependent companies  are still fighting an uphill battle as marketers rein in spending.</p><ul><li>Negative foreign exchange effects did make GOOG's performance look a bit worse than it really was. On a constant currency basis, revenue for the bread-and-butter Search and Other segment increased moderately over last year. </li><li>Staying true to recent form, the retail and travel categories exhibited strength, while finance was a laggard. Broadly speaking, though, the company experienced a further pullback in advertiser spend, with CEO Sundar Pichai commenting that the macroeconomic climate has become more challenging.</li><li>Enterprises aren't just becoming more judicious with their marketing investments. A common theme among technology companies is that some of their customers are reducing or delaying IT expenditures, and GOOG isn't immune to this phenomenon. Although Google Cloud generated solid revenue growth of 32%, that's down from 38% last quarter. That lags <strong>Microsoft</strong> (<strong>MSFT</strong>) Azure's Q4 growth of 38%, but it's well ahead of the 20% growth achieved by <strong>Amazon</strong> (<strong>AMZN</strong>) Web Services. What's concerning, though, is that MSFT guided for a 4-5% decline for Azure in 1Q23, indicating that enterprise IT spending has weakened further.</li><li>The good news is that Google Cloud's operating losses are now shrinking. After narrowing to ($699) mln from ($858) mln last quarter, Cloud's operating loss improved to ($480) mln in Q4. During the earnings call, both Mr. Pichai and CFO Ruth Porat stated that the company remains "very focused on Google Cloud's path to profitability."</li><li>That sharpened focus on profitability extends to the rest of the company. GOOG is reengineering its entire cost structure as it slows the pace of its operating expense growth. On January 20, GOOG ramped up its cost-cutting efforts when it announced a workforce reduction of 12,000 roles, but its plan doesn't end there. </li><li>In 2023, the pace of hiring will slow considerably, while at the same time, the use of AI and automation is expected to improve productivity across operational tasks. Additionally, a tighter lid on spending with suppliers and vendors, combined with real estate optimization, will drive more cost savings. One caveat, however, is that most of the impact from these actions won't filter through until 2024.</li></ul><p>Beyond the enhanced focus on expenses, there are a couple other key positives to note. </p><ul><li>For instance, YouTube Shorts, which is GOOG's answer to TikTok's short-format video platform, is experiencing strong growth. Specifically, Shorts is now averaging 50 bln daily views compared to 30 bln at the end of Q3. Importantly, the monetization of Shorts is progressing with GOOG introducing revenue sharing this week.</li><li>Another bright spot was the subscription business, which helped drive a 7.7% revenue increase for GOOG's "Other" segment. In particular, YouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV generated substantial subscriber growth, helping to offset continued weakness in Play revenue.</li><li>Lastly, GOOG spent a significant portion of last night's earnings call discussing its opportunities in AI, which Mr. Pichai described as "the most profound technology its working on today." Within the advertising business, GOOG intends to use AI to deliver improved search experiences and better measurement tools, driving higher ROI for advertisers. Outside of advertising, GOOG disclosed that it will make its LaMDA language available to the public soon, enabling people to interact directly with it as a companion to search.</li></ul><p>The main takeaway is that it was another disappointing quarter for GOOG, but the EPS miss isn't overly surprising given that GOOG was late to the cost-cutting party. We believe that most investors already looked past this earnings report and are weighing whether 2023 will hold better results. By prioritizing improvements to its cost base and investing in its most promising opportunities, such as AI, YouTube Shorts, and Subscriptions, a meaningful turnaround could indeed transpire this year.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
