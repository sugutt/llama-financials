<html><body><p>Last Friday, <strong>Alphabet (GOOG)</strong> announced that it no longer plans to launch its Plex app, which would have allowed Google Pay users to create checking accounts and send money to friends. Despite this development, we still think GOOG is likely to launch a similar offering in the future. </p><p> Originally, through a partnership with <strong>Citigroup (C)</strong> and Stanford Federal Credit Union, users would have been able to open a bank account within Google Pay and send money to friends. GOOG's plan was to directly compete with <strong>PayPal's (PYPL)</strong> Venmo and <strong>Square's (SQ)</strong> Cash App. It was part of a broader effort by GOOG to bolster its fintech offerings and further compete with many other fintech companies, such as <strong>Apple (AAPL)</strong>, <strong>Facebook (FB)</strong>, and <strong>Alibaba (BABA)</strong>. </p><p>We also think that it makes a lot of sense for GOOG to launch this type of app. </p><ul><li> For one, the pandemic has fueled a boom in contactless payment options. Also, Android OS makes up about 46% of the North American mobile OS market (according to Statista), so Google is already on millions of individuals' smartphones. Therefore, we see it as a good fit for GOOG to convert many of these individuals into Google checking account holders. </li><li>It also appears as though AAPL is faring well with its Apple Card offering. Although this is not the same as what GOOG planned to launch, it represents another tech giant competing in the financial sector. In late October 2020, during the company's Q4 (Sep) earnings call, CEO Tim Cook stated that Apple Card was doing well, while Apple Pay was doing exceptionally well. </li><li> Lastly, SQ boasts over 70 mln active customers on its Cash App as of Q2 (Jun) while it has seen revs more than double and even triple over the past four quarters as the company has seen an explosion in people shifting to contactless payments. Meanwhile, GOOG already reportedly has about 100 mln Google Pay users, so the company would already be entering this space with plenty of interest. In fact, on Friday, Citigroup stated it had about 400K people on the waiting list to sign up for Plex. </li></ul><p>Bottom line, despite GOOG's plans to not go through with Plex, we still think the company will be launching something similar in the future. <strong>With contactless payments looking like the dominant way to pay moving forward and GOOG already having a robust digital payment offering in Google Pay, it only makes sense for the tech giant to release a payments app in the future.</strong></p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
