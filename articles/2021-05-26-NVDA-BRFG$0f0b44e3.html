<html><body><strong>NVIDIA </strong>(<strong>NVDA</strong>), which has emerged as a powerhouse within the semiconductor space, is scheduled to report 1Q22 (ending January) results after the close today with a conference call following at 5:00 p.m. E.T. The company has been on an absolute tear over the past year, decimating analysts' earnings and revenue expectations along the way. More of the same is expected tonight, as evidenced by the stock's ~10% run higher over the past week.<br><br>Back on April 12, the leading GPU maker reported that Q1 revenue is tracking above the $5.30 bln outlook it provided during the Q4 earnings conference call. CFO Colette Kress added that the outperformance is being driven by strength across each of the company's segments and that demand is expected to exceed supply for most of the year. Since that update, analysts' estimates have crept higher to $5.4 bln from $5.2 bln. On the bottom-line, NVDA is forecasted to generate EPS of $3.28.<br><br>With each passing quarter, NVDA has one-upped itself in terms of surpassing consensus estimates. Last quarter, the company crushed the EPS estimate by $1.12, following beats of $0.99 and $0.50 in the two preceding quarters. The story on the top-line is very similar as growth has accelerated from the upper-30% range in 1Q21 to over 60% in 4Q21, resulting in substantial upside performance.&nbsp;<br><br>There are a few catalysts underlying NVDA's rise, but the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and the company's strong technological position within AI is at the core of its success. This is especially true in the data center market&nbsp;as the infusion of AI technologies across cloud computing providers has created a windfall for the company. Last quarter, NVDA's Data Center (DC) segment posted growth of 97%, which actually represented a slowdown from Q3's 162% surge.&nbsp;<br><br>Traditionally, NVDA is known for making graphics chips for gaming systems. However, NVDA's gaming segment has recently jockeyed back-and-forth with the DC segment for the top spot within the company. This development speaks more to the emergence of the DC unit than it does to a slowdown in the gaming segment. In fact, gaming revenue jumped by an impressive 67% last quarter to $2.5 bln (~50% of total revenue), due to the increasing popularity of gaming during the pandemic and the launch of new gaming consoles&nbsp;(PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch).<br><br>NVDA's outstanding performance and robust growth has produced a rich valuation for the stock, illustrated by the ~44x forward P/E. NVDA bulls argue that the lofty valuation is supported by the company's considerable growth opportunities, including in the automotive and high-performance computing (HPC) markets. In particular, the company is gaining a strong foothold in autonomous driving and Robotaxis, estimating that its design-win pipeline for NVIDIA DRIVE technology totals more than $8 bln over the next six years.&nbsp;<br><br>Recall that NVDA made a major splash in the M&amp;A market with its $40 bln proposed acquisition of Arm Holdings last September. Through its newly announced "Project Grace" initiative, NVDA is already looking to capitalize on its acquisition by introducing an ARM-based CPU for the HPC and DC markets. This is an interesting and somewhat surprising development given that the acquisition is facing major antitrust scrutiny from regulators. In late April, the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>reported that the U.K. government is starting a review of the deal with an update regarding the merger's implications on national security due by July 30. Additional antitrust investigations are anticipated in the U.S., China, and EU.<br><br>Regulatory concerns aside,&nbsp;exceptional results and continued strong growth is on the horizon for NVDA. This will be reflected in the company's Q2 guidance, which may exceed analysts' forecast for revenue of $5.48 bln (42% yr/yr growth). One potential risk is that the widespread semiconductor component shortages will derail NVDA, but not even this obstacle seems to be slowing the company down.&nbsp;When NVDA upped its Q1 revenue guidance, Kress noted that the company should have sufficient supply to support sequential growth beyond Q1.<br><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
