<html><body><p><strong>Meta Platforms</strong> (<strong>META</strong>) is gaining some friends in the analyst community this week. Yesterday, Edward Jones upgraded META to Buy from Hold with the firm citing the company's expense reduction efforts and a potential stabilization in advertising revenue as key factors underlying the more bullish outlook. Today, Morgan Stanley followed suit, upgrading the stock to Overweight from Equal-Weight while raising its price target to $250, representing a 23% increase versus the current price.</p><ul><li>Just four months ago, sentiment from investors and analysts alike was about as bearish as it has ever been for META. Following the company's disappointing 3Q22 earnings report in which it missed EPS expectations and guided for a 15% yr/yr increase in expenses for FY23, the stock caught several downgrades. One of those downgrades was at Morgan Stanley, which lowered its rating to Equal-Weight from Overweight.</li><li>In the aftermath of that earnings report in late October and the downgrades that accompanied it, shares of META sank to their lowest level since early 2016. Not only were investors dismayed by META's rapidly declining top-line growth -- which has dipped into negative territory in each of the past three quarters -- but frustrations over the company's free-wheeling spending style had also reached a boiling point. </li><li>Until reaching that low point in the fall, CEO Mark Zuckerberg had been unfazed by the criticism regarding his metaverse aspirations and the billions of dollars he earmarked for building out the technology.</li><li>Then everything changed, seemingly in an instant, and META began a huge cost-cutting initiative that has resulted in more than 20,000 layoffs so far. As a result, the company's FY23 total expense guidance has been reduced from the original forecast of $96-$101 bln to $86-$92 bln with Mr. Zuckerberg now calling this a "year of efficiency" for META.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The U-turn on spending is only part of the equation.</p><ul><li>META's focus on creating new AI-based tools to help mitigate the impact from <strong>Apple's</strong> (<strong>AAPL</strong>) iOS privacy changes should boost demand from advertisers as ROI improves on META's platform.</li><li>Additionally, the scrutiny that has been placed on TikTok from politicians, regulators, and the media may be taking a toll on the short-format video app. Last Friday, the U.S. Justice Department announced that it will launch an investigation into the surveillance of Americans by TikTok. A growing number of members of Congress are also backing legislation that would allow the President to ban foreign technology products like TikTok due to national security concerns.</li><li>Whether the investigation or proposed legislation ultimately leads to a ban of TikTok remains to be seen, but with the screws being turned tighter, it stands to reason that some advertisers may look elsewhere. META would be a primary beneficiary of advertisers pulling some spending away from TikToK, while <strong>Pinterest</strong> (<strong>PINS</strong>), <strong>Snap</strong> (<strong>SNAP</strong>), and <strong>Google</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>) would also benefit.</li></ul><p>The main takeaway is that sentiment continues to dramatically brighten for META, and, although business conditions are still unfavorable, the earnings outlook for FY23 is significantly better than it was a few months ago.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
