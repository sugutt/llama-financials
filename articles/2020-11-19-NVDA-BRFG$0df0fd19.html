<html><body><p>Few companies have generated financial results as impressive as <strong>NVIDIA's</strong> (<strong>NVDA</strong>) this year. The maker of graphics processing units (GPUs) was under the spotlight again last night, reporting exceptional <a bhref="https://www.briefing.com/InPlayEq/NewsFeed/newsdoc?id=793644" target="_blank">3Q20 results</a> that crushed expectations. In the words of NVDA's CEO, Jensen Huang, the company is "firing on all cylinders, achieving record revenues in Gaming, Data Center and overall."<br><br>There are plenty of superlatives that can describe NVDA's performance, but the numbers really tell the story.</p><ul><li>Data center (DC) revenue surged by 162% yr/yr to $1.90 bln. Traditionally known for its gaming chips, NVDA has rapidly expanded into the data center market, selling processors that support artificial intelligence applications. <ul><li>NVDA's 2019 acquisition of Mellanox, which develops networking chipsets used in high-performance computing, AI applications, and storage, has paid hefty dividends in the DC business. <ul><li>In Q3, Mellanox contributed ~33% of total DC sales.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Gaming revenue jumped by 37% yr/yr to $2.27 bln, up from last quarter's growth of 26%. When NVDA's 2Q20 report hit on August 19, a main storyline concerned the DC segment overtaking the gaming segment in revenue. <ul><li>That imbalance didn't last long, though, as sales of graphics cards for personal computers and new gaming systems, such as the <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> (<strong>NTDOY</strong>), fueled strong growth.</li><li>Gaming has increased in popularity during the pandemic due to limited outside-the-home entertainment options.</li></ul></li><li>In total, NVDA achieved revenue growth of 56.8%, representing its highest growth rate since 1Q18. Combined with a 140-bps improvement in Non-GAAP gross margin, EPS surged by 63% yr/yr to $2.91.</li></ul><p>Despite these robust financial metrics, NVDA shares are struggling to gain traction. </p><ul><li>With the stock up ~230% year-to-date, NVDA was facing very lofty expectations, as most of the good news has already been priced in. <ul><li>The massive rally has made the stock expensive: a 1-year forward P/E north of 50x leaves very little room for error.</li></ul></li><li>NVDA issued upside guidance, forecasting Q4 revenue of $4.80 bln, plus or minus 2%, equating to $4.704-4.896 bln vs. the $4.43 bln expectation. The problem, though, is that commentary regarding the outlook is alarming some investors. <ul><li>CFO Colette Kress stated that capacity constraints in Q4 could hinder NVDA's ability to immediately meet demand for its gaming chips. She added that it may take a few more months before product availability catches up with demand.</li><li>NVDA also expects DC revenue to be down slightly compared to Q3 due to a significant qtr/qtr decline in Mellanox revenue. <ul><li>In Q3, some revenue was pulled forward from Q4 as an un-named Chinese customer made an "unusually large" purchase.</li><li>This customer isn't expected to make another large purchase in Q4, prompting concern that some companies are stockpiling chips due to fears of future supply chain disruptions.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>With virus cases spiking around the world, any signs of pullbacks in IT spending or supply chain disruptions are going to catch investors' attention. While business is booming for NVDA, there's now some concern that factors outside of the company's control might impede its growth. Given the stock's incredible run-up and its rich valuation, it makes sense that investors are locking in some gains.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
