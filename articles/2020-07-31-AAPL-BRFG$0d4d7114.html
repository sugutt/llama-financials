<html><body><p><strong>Apple (AAPL +7%)</strong> is tasting good to investors today as the stock breaks above $400 for the first time ever. Not only was it a strong upside <a bhref="https://www.briefing.com/InPlayEq/NewsFeed/newsdoc?id=646155" target="_blank">quarter</a> for Q3 (Jun), but Apple threw in a 4-for-1 stock split for good measure. </p><ul><li>EPS and revenue both came in well ahead of analyst expectations. <ul><li> The $0.51 EPS upside was Apple's largest by far in the past five years. </li><li> The company has now posted four consecutive $0.20+ EPS beats, which is unusual as Apple typically beats in the mid-single digits to low teens. </li></ul></li><li> Apple performed well across its bevy of offerings. <ul><li> iPhone revenues +1.5% yr/yr to $26.4 bln vs $22.0 bln estimates; </li><li> Services revenues +14.8% yr/yr to $13.2 bln vs $13 bln ests; </li><li> iPad +22% yr/yr to $7.08 bln; </li><li> Mac revs +31% yr/yr to $6.6 bln; </li><li>Wearables +16% yr/yr to $6.6 bln. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Apple is benefitting from the shift to at-home work/school</strong>, which has pushed people to buy new products, apps and services. The economic stimulus measures and the lifting of stay-at-home restrictions were tailwinds in May and June. </li><li><strong>What really helped the iPhone numbers was strong sales of the SE phone</strong> which launched in April 2020. <ul><li>Its $399 starting price point makes it competitive in emerging markets and attractive for people who do not need all the bells and whistles of the high-end iPhones. </li></ul></li><li> <strong>Apple pushed back the availability of its new iPhones "a few weeks later"</strong> than its usual September timeline due to supply chain issues stemming from plant closures and travel restrictions.  <ul><li>However, this was likely not a big surprise. Dan Niles was on CNBC last week saying there would likely be a month push-out. </li></ul></li><li>Another slight negative was Apple again not providing guidance for the upcoming quarter, as the manufacturing/COVID-19 issues make it difficult to predict when the new iPhones will come out. <ul><li>With that said, investors are pretty excited about this upcoming launch. For most years, the new iPhones have just had incremental improvements, like better chips or better cameras. This year will be a big step up as Apple will finally debut its long-awaited 5G iPhone. Even without guidance, it's safe to assume there will be huge demand for the 5G phones. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Finally, the stock split as a nice cherry on top.</strong> We know it should not matter what the stock price is, but it does matter for a lot of investors and makes it easier for small investors to buy in. </li></ul><p><strong>Overall, this was a fantastic quarter for Apple</strong> with a huge beat and what's notable is that there was not a significant weak spot among any product category. Often, a category or two do not carry their weight, but JunQ was uniformly good. Some guidance would have been nice and the iPhone delay by a few weeks is slightly disappointing, but these items were pretty much expected. Looking ahead, the 5G iPhone should be a big tailwind although more for DecQ probably and not for SepQ.  </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
