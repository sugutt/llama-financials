<html><body><p> <strong>Apple (AAPL)</strong> is set to host its annual iPhone event today at 1:00 p.m. ET, at which the most valuable US-based company is expected to launch a new Apple Watch and redesigned AirPods along with a new edition of its most valuable product, the iPhone. It appears that only limited improvements are expected for the iPhone, including the usual (better battery, camera, processor) plus expanded storage, a smaller notch, improved MagSafe, and new colors. A similar theme goes for the Apple Watch 7, which is expected to receive a slightly bigger screen (~1 mm), reduced bezels, and extended battery life.</p><p>  iPhone is where AAPL makes the bulk of its revenue (~49% in Q3), with Services (~21%), which includes AppleCare and digital content, quickly making up a large overall piece of total revenue. Each of AAPL's other segments - Mac, iPad, and Wearables and Accessories - makes up about 10% of revenue. Although the company's iPhone event today should unveil only minor changes to the iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods relative to models from the year before, we think certain additional factors at play could continue to provide a tailwind for AAPL moving forward. Wearables and Accessories may only make up about 10% of total revs, but this segment grew revenues faster than every other segment on a two-year stack in Q3 (Jun). </p><ul><li>Wearable and Accessories leaped 58.8% in Q3 from 2019 while iPhone and Services grew 52.2% and 52.6% from 2019, respectively. Already on the iPhone, 5G will likely play a massive role in driving growth for internet of things (IoT) devices, such as the Apple Watch (which is included in Wearables and Accessories). This is because 5G can provide real-time updates through its low latency and high-speed connectivity. </li><li>AAPL is continuously developing and innovating augmented reality (AR). With the iPhone 12 last year, AAPL brought LiDAR (first introduced on its iPad in early 2020) to iPhone. LiDAR is crucial to AR, as it enables accurate environment maps to be created nearly instantly instead of by detecting the room one wall, table, etc., at a time. AR is already being developed for mapping outer space and assisting self-driving vehicles. Also, companies such as <strong>Facebook (FB)</strong> and <strong>Walmart (WMT) </strong>are looking for developers to build new AR applications, showing the ramping up of demand in the AR space. </li><li>Lastly, it was reported that AAPL would be using the <strong>Qualcomm (QCOM)</strong> X60 chip, which allows for emergency satellite calls. Although it may only be implemented in select markets, we think that bringing this technology, which is only found on bulky satellite-connected phones, to the consumer phone industry allows for massive potential. If AAPL continues to expand upon this tech, it could be indicative of the company setting its sights on disrupting the traditional telecom industry. </li></ul><p>Bottom line, the iPhone event today should bring modest changes that may only excite tech-enthusiasts and Apple fans. However, for buy-and-hold investors, we think AAPL's iPhone event plays a critical role in detailing the company's strategic direction. As certain technologies continue to be developed, AAPL could be the company to bring them to the mainstream. On a final note, the stock tends to see a bit of a sell-the-news reaction to these events, so it would be unusual to see a big move in the stock today.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
