<html><body><p>After a rough Q4 (Sep), <strong>Apple (AAPL 166.12, +6.90, +4.3%)</strong> bounced back with a nice upside result in Q1 (Dec). As important as the report's EPS and revenue numbers were, we think Apple's commentary on supply constraints was even better music to investors' ears. </p><ul><li> <strong>The headline numbers featured solid beats</strong> on EPS and revenue, constituting a big improvement from SepQ's in-line EPS result. </li><li> <strong>iPhone, Mac, and Wearables sales all exceeded analyst expectations.</strong> iPad results, however, fell short. Demand remains robust, but that product faced the most severe component shortages. Services revenue was basically in-line, maybe a slight miss. </li><li><strong>iPhone sales were boosted by the launch of iPhone 13.</strong> Revenue climbed 9% yr/yr to an all-time record of $71.6 bln, despite supply constraints. </li><li> <strong>Mac revenue was the biggest growth category</strong>, up 25% yr/yr to $10.9 bln, also an all-time record, despite supply constraints. Apple is seeing strong demand for its newly redesigned MacBook Pro. Of note, Apple is now one year into its transition to Apple silicon, and already the vast majority of Mac sales are from M1-powered devices. </li><li><strong>iPad was the main trouble area. </strong>Its sales fell 14% yr/yr to $7.25 bln due to significant supply constraints. The good news here is that iPad is by far Apple's smallest category at 6% of total sales; iPhone, meanwhile, accounts for 58% of sales. </li><li><strong>The supply constraints have been long forecast by Apple</strong>, so their impact does not come as a big surprise. Apple warned about component shortages on its earnings call in late July, expecting the constraints to primarily impact iPhone and iPad. Then during its SepQ call in October, Apple said that constraints would cause a larger hit to DecQ revs than the $6 bln experienced in SepQ. During the Q&amp;A, Apple conceded that did happen.</li><li> <strong>The good news today is</strong> that Apple now expects fewer supply constraints in MarQ than it had in DecQ. </li></ul><p> <strong>Bottom line, this DecQ report was welcome after the rough SepQ.</strong> Demand remains robust across the board, and iPhone 13 sales were strong. A takeaway here is that even a tech behemoth like Apple is not immune from the global component shortage. The timing of the shortage was unfortunate, as it hit just as Apple introduced its iPhone 13 lineup as well as the Apple Watch Series 7, new iPad, and iPad mini, all of which represent significant advances. </p><p>However, investors should take comfort in the prospect that supply constraint issues should ease up in MarQ for Apple. We had trepidation heading into this report after <strong>Intel (INTC)</strong> pushed back its timeline for supply constraint improvement on Wednesday. Intel now expects ecosystem constraints to persist through 2022 and into 2023 vs prior guidance for gradual improvement heading into 2022. So, we take Apple's outlook as a win. It's also good news for Apple suppliers like <strong>SWKS, QRVO, CRUS, AVGO, TSM, QCOM, SMH, LPL, LITE, FNSR, </strong>and <strong>IIVI</strong>. Many of those names will report over the coming weeks.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
