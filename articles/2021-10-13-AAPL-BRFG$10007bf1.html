<html><body><p><strong>Apple (AAPL -1%)</strong> is trading modestly lower today on a <em>Bloomberg</em> report indicating that the company is likely to slash its projected iPhone 13 production targets for 2021 by as many as 10 mln units due to chip shortages. The article says that <strong>Broadcom (AVGO) </strong>and <strong>Texas Instruments (TXN)</strong> are struggling to deliver enough components. </p><p><strong>Here's our quick take on what this means:</strong> </p><ul><li><strong>First off, this is not a huge surprise, </strong>as Apple warned about component shortages during its earnings call in late July. Apple did not provide a lot of detail on the situation but did say that supply constraints during Q4 (Sep) would likely be greater than those seen in Q3 (Jun), with the constraints primarily impacting iPhone and iPad. The latest nodes, which Apple uses in several of its products, have not been much of an issue, but legacy nodes have been impacted by supply constraints on silicon. </li><li><strong>It also shows that even a tech behemoth like Apple is not immune</strong> to the global chip shortage. The timing of the shortage is unfortunate, as it's coming just as Apple unveiled the new iPhone 13 last month. Consumers should expect delays in getting their new iPhones. It's also bad news for Apple suppliers like <strong>SWKS, QRVO, CRUS, AVGO, TSM, QCOM, SMH, LPL, LITE, FNSR</strong>, and<strong> IIVI</strong>. </li><li>Apple declined to provide guidance with its JunQ report due to uncertainty, but this news is likely shave some analyst estimates for Q1 (Dec) and Q2 (Mar). iPhone is by far Apple's largest revenue generator (54% of total YTD sales). </li><li><strong>This is likely to be a theme with all sorts of companies when earnings season gets into high gear next week.</strong> Within tech, software companies are unlikely to be affected much, but we suspect most every hardware company will be warning about component shortages. </li></ul><p> <strong>With shortages being a given this earnings season, the key will be getting companies' takes on how long the challenges will last. Ford (F) </strong>was actually pretty positive this summer, saying that Q2 had been the low point and chips were flowing better in Q3. However, we think that rosy outlook may change. <strong>Cisco (CSCO)</strong>, a great bellwether for tech, expects challenges to continue through at least the first half of FY22 (ending January 31) and potentially into the second half of FY22 (July 2022). </p><p> <strong>Bottom line, this news is troubling to hear, though not totally unexpected </strong>based on Apple's July comments. We think that's why the stock is holding up fairly well. Supply challenges are going to be the main theme for lots of companies across many industries this earnings season. We think that's a given - the main issue now surrounds their duration. Investors should understand that this is going to multi-quarter problem, so investors should not look for a quick fix. Even a stellar company like Apple is not immune.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
