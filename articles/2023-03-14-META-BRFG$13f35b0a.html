<html><body><p>In the span of about six months, <strong>Meta Platforms</strong> (<strong>META</strong>) went from  full speed ahead on its metaverse aspirations, ready to invest whatever it took to support that transition, to one that's cutting costs more aggressively than virtually any other tech company. This morning, META published a Newsroom post that provided more details about its "year of efficiency", including a plan to lay off about 10,000 more employees, while also closing around 5,000 additional roles that META hasn't yet filled.</p><ul><li>These layoffs are on top of the 11,000 positions that were eliminated late last year as META and other social media companies like <strong>Snap</strong> (<strong>SNAP</strong>), <strong>Pinterest</strong> (<strong>PINS</strong>), and Twitter contended with a sharp slowdown in digital advertising spending and rising competition from TikTok. </li><li>As difficult as the business climate has been, it has forced META and CEO Mark Zuckerberg to refocus and prioritize the company's bottom-line, and, by extension, the profitable Family of Apps (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) segment.</li><li>Rewinding to META's disappointing 3Q22 earnings report on October 26, in which it missed EPS expectations for the third time in four quarters, the company guided for FY23 total expenses of $96-$101 bln. At the midpoint, this outlook reflected a yr/yr increase of 15% and seemed a bit tone-deaf given the rough business conditions. Not surprisingly, the stock was crushed the following day to the tune of a 25% drop.</li></ul><p>Since then, though, it's been a completely different story for META and the stock.</p><ul><li>A couple weeks after that dreadful earnings report, the company lowered its FY23 expense guidance to $94-$100 bln&nbsp;due to slower anticipated growth in payroll expenses and cost of revenue. Then, when META reported Q4 earnings in early February, it cut its FY23 expense guidance again, this time to $89-$95 bln. Now, after taking into account these latest layoffs, META is forecasting total expenses to be in a range of $86-$92 bln, representing an increase of just 1.5% at the mid-point.</li><li>Job cuts are only part of the solution. META is also looking to "flatten the organization" by removing multiple layers of management, while asking some managers to also be contributors. </li><li>Additionally, instead of sinking billions of dollars into the money-losing Reality Labs division (Metaverse, VR equipment), spending will be almost&nbsp;entirely allocated to tools that enhance META's applications, making them more competitive and attractive to advertisers. Most notably, this will include expanding its AI capabilities to improve monetization and to increase ROI for advertisers.</li></ul><p>All of this has been music to investors ears, as illustrated by the stock's near 100% gain since that Q3 earnings report. The bottom line is that while advertising demand is still shaky at best, META's earnings expectations are on the rise, thanks to a dramatic U-turn on spending that's still playing out.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
