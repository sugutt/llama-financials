<html><body><p><strong>NVIDIA's (NVDA +1%)</strong> downbeat Q3 (Oct) revenue guidance ignited a slight sell-the-news reaction to start today's trading session as it made clear the issues from Q2 (Jul), notably weak Gaming and Professional Visualization demand, would persist. Recall that the chipmaker already provided Q2 numbers earlier this month, so all eyes were on its Q3 forecast. NVDA expects Q3 revs to fall yr/yr for the first time since 3Q19, guiding to sales of $5.78-6.02 bln, well below consensus. </p><p>Although Q3 projections were bleak when stacked against estimates, <strong>shares are holding up relatively well today</strong>. We think this is largely due to optimism that the worst of NVDA's issues should shake out by the end of Q3.</p><p>NVDA's strategy is to reduce Gaming sell-in (sales to distributors) over the next couple of quarters to allow channel inventory to correct ahead of the company's next generation of products. Meanwhile, its Hopper architecture, which is NVDA's next-gen platform for data centers, is in full production and the company expects to ship "substantial" Hoppers in Q4 (Jan). Also, regarding NVDA's Data Center segment, which hit a snag in Q2 due to a slowdown in China, the company mentioned that this deceleration cannot last indefinitely given the sheer number of people utilizing the cloud. NVDA also commented that its Automotive segment hit an inflection point in Q2, with growth to continue into Q3 and Q4. </p><p>With investors hopeful that most of NVDA's woes are in the rear-view mirror, the company's Q2 numbers are being mainly overlooked. </p><ul><li>As expected, revs grew just 3% yr/yr to $6.7 bln. Gaming weighed on overall sales growth as demand softened considerably, sending revs to tumble 33% yr/yr to $2.04 bln. Along those same lines, Professional Visualization also took a spill, falling 4% to $496 mln. <ul><li> Due to NVDA's reduction in the sell-in over the next couple of quarters, the company expects Gaming revenue to remain a weak point in Q3. This echoes thoughts from rival <strong>Advanced Micro (AMD)</strong>, which predicted a challenging gaming market in Q3, but remains focused on executing its GPU road map. </li><li> NVDA still believes long-term gaming trends remain strong, especially after the pandemic spurred a renewed demand for gaming as a form of entertainment and social connectivity. </li></ul></li><li> Data Center sales jumping 61% yr/yr and 2% sequentially to $3.81 bln was a positive development. However, component shortages and a slowdown of investment from Chinese hyperscalers caused growth to be lighter than NVDA expected. <ul><li> NVDA remains confident that demand is still there, affirming what we heard from <strong>Taiwan Semi (TSM)</strong> last month, which expects high-performance computing (HPC) to be the main engine of its long-term growth. </li><li>Also, even though Q3 revs are expected to fall yr/yr, Data Center sales will see positive mid-single-digit growth sequentially, a minor acceleration from the qtr/qtr growth seen in Q2. </li></ul></li></ul><p> As expected, Q2 was a challenging quarter, and Q3 is not shaping up to be much better. However, today's price movement indicates that the market is not expecting NVDA's troubles to worsen after Q3 and is mostly applauding its strategy to return to growth in subsequent quarters. <strong>We remain bullish on NVDA for the long term and think current price levels offer an attractive entry point</strong>. Nevertheless, with a premium valuation of around 39x forward earnings, shares may undergo some turbulence in the near term.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
