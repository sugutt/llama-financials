<html><body><p><strong>NVIDIA's (NVDA) </strong>Q3 (Oct) earnings report contained some positive developments, including what appears to be a bottom in Gaming revenue. However, the chip maker's second-straight earnings miss and light Q4 revenue guidance are keeping shares in check. The broader markets ticking lower is also a factor weighing on the price.</p><ul><li> Investors were likely not expecting robust headline results in Q3 after several chip makers warned of a rapidly deteriorating demand backdrop in the months leading up to NVDA's report. In fact, NVDA already warned that Q3 would be challenging last quarter, expecting sequential declines in its Gaming (~26% of total revs) and Professional Visualization (~3%) segments, as well as a 460 bp contraction in non-GAAP gross margins yr/yr to 62.4% (the midpoint of its prior guidance). </li><li>Although NVDA's Gaming and ProViz predictions materialized, declining 23% and 60% qtr/qtr, respectively, margins dipped further than expected, tumbling 10.9 pts yr/yr to 56.1%. This helped fuel NVDA's double-digit adjusted EPS miss, a blemish that may be clouding out other positives. </li><li>One such positive was revenues falling less than analysts anticipated, dropping 16.5% yr/yr to $5.93 bln. The heavy lifter here was NVDA's Data Center segment (~65%), which delivered 31% growth yr/yr and 1% sequentially. NVDA remarked that growth was broad-based across leading U.S. cloud service providers, consumer internet firms, and other vertical industries. Meanwhile, the weak sequential growth was mainly due to lingering fragility in China. </li><li>NVDA's Q4 revenue guidance of $5.88-6.12 bln slightly missed estimates. However, we think it is better to focus on the silver lining that NVDA expects a sequential improvement in Gaming sales, signaling that the worst of the slowdown in demand may be over. Recall NVDA's strategy last quarter was to reduce sell-in over Q2 (Jul)-Q4 (Jan) to let channel inventories correct. NVDA is still working through the correction, but given the sequential growth forecast, NVDA seems on track to deliver on its Q2 expectation to enter FY23 in good shape.<ul><li>  Margins are also expected to make a good recovery, with NVDA targeting non-GAAP gross margins of 65.5-66.5% in Q4, translating to only a 100 bp contraction yr/yr at the midpoint. </li></ul></li></ul><p> Even though investors do not seem to have much appetite for NVDA shares today, the company's Q3 report was mostly positive. There are still a few lingering concerns, such as softening Gaming and Data Center demand in China, which cropped up toward the end of Q2. China is NVDA's second-largest market in terms of where products are initially billed, comprising around 26% of total revs in FY22 (second to Taiwan at ~32%). Hence, weakness in the region adds a layer of uncertainty. ProViz is also finding it more difficult to recover than Gaming, with NVDA forecasting flattish growth qtr/qtr in Q4. Still, we think NVDA remains a solid long-term play but caution that its relatively pricey ~40x forward earnings multiple, a sizeable premium to <strong>Advanced Micro (AMD)</strong> at ~23x and <strong>Intel (INTC)</strong> at ~20x, could continue to create volatility in the near term. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
