<html><body>Coming off an exceptional Q4 performance in which Google parent <strong>Alphabet</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>) crushed EPS and revenue estimates, the company faced sky-high expectations heading into its Q1 report. What GOOG's stellar results demonstrated last quarter was that advertising spending was recovering in a more forceful and rapid way than had been anticipated. <br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Since then, economies have begun to reopen and vaccinations have been widely distributed, fueling an upswing in spending in categories that were hammered by the pandemic: namely, travel and leisure, dining, and shopping at brick-and-mortar stores. It's well-understood that GOOG's search and advertising businesses are perfectly aligned to capitalize on these developments, given that many companies within those recovering spaces use GOOG for marketing purposes. Consequently, this meant that GOOG needed to hurdle an even higher bar than last quarter to keep the stock moving higher.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Amazingly, the company did just that, obliterating the top and bottom-line forecasts as total revenue surged by 34% yr/yr, marking its strongest growth rate in over five years. The recovery seen in advertising spending blossomed into a full-blown resurgence, while GOOG's cloud segment continues to produce strong double-digit growth.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Google advertising, which includes search and YouTube ads, exhibited accelerating momentum, with revenue up 32% to $44.7 bln (~81% of total revenue) compared to 22% growth in Q4. During the earnings conference call, CFO Ruth Porat acknowledged that the increase was partly due to the lapping of the initial impact of the pandemic that hit in March. However, she also stated that GOOG experienced broad-based increases in advertising spending, with the retail and tech categories standing out.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Travel is another key industry for GOOG that is showing significant improvement. Earlier in this earnings season, major carriers like <strong>Delta Air Lines</strong> (<strong>DAL</strong>), <strong>Southwest Air</strong> (<strong>LUV</strong>), and <strong>United Airlines</strong> (<strong>UAL</strong>) reported that demand for leisure travel has returned in a meaningful way. Last night, GOOG's Chief Business Officer, Philipp Schindler, echoed that sentiment, stating that the company is seeing renewed interest for travel as users turn to GOOG to plan their next trip before they're ready to book. In turn, airlines, hotels, travel booking companies, entertainment venues, and other travel-related companies are ramping up advertising spending to capitalize on consumers' increasing search activity.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Meanwhile, YouTube continues to shine as momentum builds in direct response advertising. Following last quarter's 47% jump, YouTube advertising revenue soared by 50% yr/yr to $6.0 bln. During the pandemic, YouTube benefited from stay-at-home mandates because people increasingly used the site for entertainment purposes and to find useful information regarding COVID-19. Based on the uptick in growth this quarter, it's safe to say that the return of some normalcy to life hasn't hindered YouTube yet. <br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Unlike the more volatile advertising business, GOOG's cloud segment has churned out steady and healthy revenue growth. In fact, the 45% top-line growth generated in Q1 essentially matched last quarter's 46% figure. According to CEO Sundar Pichai, a few different trends are driving growth in the could segment, including strong customer momentum in the data cloud, the desire from customers to create operational efficiencies and to reduce IT costs, and the rise of hybrid cloud environments. <br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">These catalysts are expected to continue into the foreseeable future, prompting GOOG to ramp up its investments in its cloud offerings. Consequently, this segment generated an operating loss of nearly $1 bln, with more losses likely in the coming quarters. Over time, though, the company believes that the cloud segment will benefit from increased scale.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">To top off the spectacular quarterly performance, GOOG also authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $50 bln of its Class C capital stock. Simply put, we're struggling to punch any holes in this report, and the Q2 outlook is just as bullish as economies continue to reopen and as GOOG laps easier yr/yr comparisons.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
