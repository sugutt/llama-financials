<html><body><p><strong>Apple (AAPL) </strong>is tasting delicious to investors today after reporting impressive Q2 (Mar) earnings results last night. The headline numbers were quite good. Apple reported a huge $0.42 EPS beat, well ahead of the $0.27 beat reported last quarter. Probably even more impressive was revenue jumping 53.6% yr/yr to a new MarQ record high of $89.58 bln, well above the $76.84 bln consensus. Mac and Services delivered all-time record results, and Apple set new MarQ records for iPhone and Wearables sales. </p><p> Apple performed very well across its bevy of offerings, with strong double-digit growth in several product categories: iPhone sales jumped 66% yr/yr to $47.9 bln vs. $41.0 bln estimates; Mac sales jumped 70% yr/yr to $9.1 bln vs $6.6 bln ests; iPad sales increased 79% yr/yr to $7.8 bln vs $5.7 bln ests; Wearables sales rose 25% yr/yr to $7.8 bln vs $7.6 bln ests; and finally, Services revenue rose 27% yr/yr to $16.9 bln vs $15.7 bln ests. </p><p>Key takeaways from the quarter: </p><ul><li>The iPhone 12 launched in DecQ, but there was a spillover effect into MarQ. The model, Apple's first 5G phone, has been very popular with both upgraders and new customers. This is great news for iPhone suppliers, including <strong>QCOM </strong>and <strong>CRUS</strong>. </li><li>iPad and Mac sales have been fueled by the pandemic. Over the past year, tens of millions of iPads and Macs have been sold to help students learn and employees work remotely. </li><li>It was great to see Mac sales snap back with a huge quarter. Mac sales were a bit light in DecQ, likely on some pull-forward sales in SepQ due to back-to-school and remote learning. However, taking the three most recent quarters together, this was Mac's best three-quarter period ever. </li><li> One area of disappointment may be Apple's decision to continue not providing guidance. On the call, the company guided to strong double-digit revenue growth, but the outlook was not very specific. Given how strong sales have been and in light of the economy re-opening, we think it's time Apple starts guiding again. Blaming the pandemic is starting to feel a bit dated. </li></ul><p><strong>Overall, this was a great quarter for Apple. </strong>It was great to see upside sales in all categories. Sometimes Apple can stumble a bit, like it did last quarter with Macs, but MarQ was uniformly good. The iPhone 12 launch was a big success that spilled over into MarQ. Our one concern is whether we'll see any turbulence in Mac and iPad sales in the next few quarters as we lap the start of the pandemic. This is where guidance would have been very helpful. Nevertheless, Apple's MarQ results were impressive.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
