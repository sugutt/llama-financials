<html><body>Expectations were sky-high heading into <strong>Alphabet's</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>) 2Q21 earnings report, and the company didn't disappoint by delivering blockbuster results. Last week,  <strong>Twitter</strong> (<strong>TWTR</strong>) and <strong>Snap</strong> (<strong>SNAP</strong>) raised the bar for GOOG after the social media companies posted strong quarterly results that were fueled by healthy advertising spending. The impressive showings from TWTR and SNAP indicated that another huge earnings beat could be in store for GOOG, extending a string of blowouts that dates back to 2Q20.<br><br>With the stock trading near record highs and up 17% since GOOG last reported earnings on April 27, anything short of another blowout report would have likely sparked a profit-taking pull-back. By crushing analysts' EPS expectations by $8.18, and with revenue surging by 62% yr/yr, the Q2 results gratified even the most bullish of investors. Within the report, perhaps the biggest upside surprise was the 84% surge in YouTube ad revenue to $7.0 bln.<br><br>At the center of GOOG's stunning performance is a powerful upswing in online activity that seems to only have strengthened in the aftermath of the pandemic. Even as businesses have reopened their brick-and-mortar stores, e-commerce activity remains robust. During yesterday's earnings conference call, Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler commented that retail was by far the largest driver behind GOOG's 69% growth in total advertising revenue. For a point of comparison, total Google advertising jumped by 32% last quarter.<br><br>For a company that generated $50.4 bln in total advertising revenue, the high double-digit growth rate is truly amazing. One caveat, though, is that GOOG is lapping very favorable yr/yr comps. In fact, in 2Q20, the company suffered the first ever yr/yr revenue decline in its ads business as advertising sales sank by 8%. During that time, the pandemic had shut down the economy, as illustrated by the 32.9% nose-dive in 2Q20 GDP, leading businesses to cut advertising budgets.<br><br>On a related note, CFO Ruth Porat reminded analysts and investors last night that the benefits of lapping favorable yr/yr comparisons will diminish moving forward. To put that statement into perspective, revenue growth accelerated from 14% in 3Q20, to 23.5% in 4Q20, and then to 34.4% in 1Q21.<br><br>She also continues to take a cautious approach with guidance by stating that it's still too early to begin making forecasts, especially as COVID cases rise again around the world. Also, from GOOG's perspective, refraining from providing specific guidance has worked out quite well since the Street continues to badly underestimate the strength behind its business, resulting in blowout results.<br><br>The strength isn't relegated to GOOG's advertising business. Google Cloud continues to grow rapidly; revenue climbed by 53% yr/yr to $4.6 bln. Along with the ever-increasing amount of data moving to the cloud, the company's expertise in AI, machine learning, and data analytics are credited by CEO Sundar Pichai as key competitive advantages that are driving Cloud's growth. Furthermore, GOOG's experience in building secure computing systems has helped it secure contracts in the enterprise space.<br><br>GOOG is firing on all cylinders, and the outlook remains bullish for the tech behemoth. Unless the economy suffers another COVID-related setback, GOOG's dominant online advertising platform and its expanding cloud business should continue to drive strong results for the foreseeable future.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
