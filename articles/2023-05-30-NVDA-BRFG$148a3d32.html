<html><body><p><strong>NVIDIA's</strong> (<strong>NVDA</strong>) meteoric run is showing no signs of slowing with shares pushing to all-time highs yet again following a series of announcements over the weekend that included the launch of several new AI-based products. The company's rising momentum in AI through its expanding lineup of GPUs fueled last week's incredible earnings report that featured a Q2 outlook that crushed expectations, sending shares skyrocketing higher.&nbsp;<br><br>Including today's gains, NVDA has soared by 178% on a year-to-year basis, blowing away rival chip makers like <strong>Advanced Micro Devices</strong> (<strong>AMD</strong>) and <strong>Intel </strong>(<strong>INTC</strong>), which are up by 95% and 10%, respectively.</p><ul><li>What NVDA's earnings report showed was that the company is separating itself from the pack in the race to develop chips that not only power generative AI applications such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, but also underpin many other AI-related technologies. <ul><li>CEO Jensen Huang&nbsp;stated in the Q1 earnings press release that companies are "racing to apply generative AI into every product, service, and business process." </li><li>More specifically, Mr. Huang highlighted robotics, gaming, advertising, and networking as a few areas where NVDA's AI-based chips will be in high demand.</li></ul></li></ul><p>To capitalize on the AI boom, NVDA is launching a set of new products that could significantly extend its lead over the competition.</p><ul><li>The headliner is a new system called "DGX GH200", an AI supercomputer that's powered by 256 of NVDA's GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips. For some context, this new supercomputer has almost 500x the memory of NVDA's previous DGX A100 system. <ul><li>According to the company, this new large-memory AI supercomputer will "enable the development of giant, next-generation models for generative AI language applications, recommender systems and data analytics workloads."</li><li><strong>Google</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>), <strong>Microsoft</strong> (<strong>MSFT</strong>), and <strong>Meta Platforms</strong> (<strong>META</strong>) will be the first companies to use the DGX GH200 platform as they build out their generative AI capabilities.</li></ul></li></ul><p>In addition to the new product launches, NVDA also announced two key collaborations that should move the needle on the top-line. </p><ul><li><strong>Softbank</strong> (<strong>SFTBY</strong>), the Japan-based telecom giant, is planning to develop a platform for generative AI and 5G/6G applications that are powered by NVDA's GH200 Grace Hopper superchip. More specifically, SFTBY intends to deploy distributed AI data centers across Japan that can host generative AI and wireless applications, helping to reduce costs and improve energy efficiency.</li><li>NVDA also announced an agreement with <strong>WPP</strong> (<strong>WPP</strong>), one of the world's largest advertising and marketing agencies. WPP is creating a content engine based on NVIDIA Omniverse --&nbsp;a platform for connecting 3D tools and developing digitalization applications -- that will enable its clients to create ads more quickly and in a very personalized way. <ul><li>The NVIDA Omniverse will link with other content creation tools, such as Getty Images and <strong>Adobe</strong> (<strong>ADBE</strong>), facilitating a user friendly and efficient platform for ad creation.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The main takeaway is that this weekend's series of announcements from NVDA further solidifies the notion that the company is at the forefront of this AI evolution and that it's only in the early innings of this powerful trend.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
