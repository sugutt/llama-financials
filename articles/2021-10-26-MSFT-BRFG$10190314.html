<html><body><p><strong>Microsoft (MSFT)</strong> is set to report Q1 (Sep) results today after the close with a call to follow at 5:30pm ET. The CapitalIQ consensus estimate for non-GAAP EPS is to grow 14% yr/yr to $2.08 and for revenue to grow 18% yr/yr to $43.99 bln. MSFT releases its results on its website, last time it was at 16:04 ET. </p><p> Microsoft operates in several areas and it's important to know the breakdown by segment: Productivity and Business Processes (Office 365, LinkedIn, Dynamics 365, which are cloud-based ERP and CRM apps), Intelligent Cloud (Azure, SQL Server, Windows Server), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Surface, Xbox). </p><p>It's important to note that MSFT typically guides on the call by segment. MSFT has guided to SepQ segments as follows: </p><ul><li>Productivity and Business Processes (PBP) revenue of $14.50-14.75 bln. </li><li> Intelligent Cloud (IC): $16.40-16.65 bln. </li><li> More Personal Computing (MPC): $12.40-12.80 bln. Add all three together, we get total revenue of $43.30-44.20 bln.</li></ul><p> <strong>MSFT tends to be very consistent in terms of beating consensus </strong>estimates with 21 EPS beats in a row, including double digit EPS beats in 9 of the past 10 quarters. Last quarter, the software giant reported another large EPS beat with its Q4 (Jun) earnings report with $0.25 upside, which was bigger than the $0.18 upside in MarQ. </p><p> <strong>A big topic for discussion will be early feedback from the Windows 11 launch </strong>on October 5. MSFT has described it as the biggest update to its operating system in a decade. It's reimagining everything from the Windows platform to the store. MSFT will launch Windows 11 in new PCs beginning this holiday season. Another area to watch is Surface, it has been working through supply chain challenges. </p><p><strong>Microsoft's crown jewel has been its Azure </strong>cloud computing business which primarily competes Amazon's (AMZN) AWS service. Azure revenue grew 51% yr/yr in JunQ vs 50% growth in MarQ, 50% growth in DecQ and 48% growth in SepQ. MSFT said in July that it expects Azure to remain stable sequentially in SepQ. Azure growth remains impressive and will be a metric to compare to Amazon's AWS when it reports on Thursday after the bell.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
