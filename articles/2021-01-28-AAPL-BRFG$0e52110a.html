<html><body><p><strong>Apple (AAPL -2%)</strong> is not tasting very good to investors despite reporting impressive Q1 (Dec) earnings results. Apple cleared the $100 bln mark in quarterly sales for the first time ever and reported consistently good results in almost every product category. However, investors do not seem overly enthused.</p><p>  The headline numbers were quite good. Apple rebounded from a modest $0.03 beat in SepQ to post a good-sized $0.27 beat in DecQ. Also, revenue jumped 21.4% yr/yr to $111.4 bln, well above the $103.24 bln consensus. Everyone expected the company to report robust iPhone sales given that Apple launched its first-ever 5G iPhone in the quarter, and Apple delivered: iPhone revs reached $65.6 bln vs. $59.9 bln estimates. </p><p> Apple performed very well across its bevy of non-iPhone offerings, reporting strong double-digit growth in several product categories: iPad revs of $8.44 bln (+41% yr/yr; +24% sequentially) vs. $7.5 bln ests; wearables of $12.97 bln (+30% yr/yr) vs. $11.6 bln ests; Macs of $8.68 bln (+21% yr/yr) vs. $8.8 bln ests; and Services of $15.76 bln (+24% yr/yr) vs $15.0 bln. </p><p><strong>So, why is the stock not up strongly today?</strong> </p><ul><li><strong>Mac sales were a bit light. </strong>The 21% yr/yr growth was below SepQ's 29% growth to $9.03 bln, and it was slightly below analyst expectations for DecQ. However, this was not a huge surprise to us after <strong>Microsoft's (MSFT) </strong>earnings report this week. Surface also saw a slowdown in sales. This makes sense given that SepQ included the back-to-school season, which was fueled by purchases made to meet the demands of remote learning. </li><li><strong>Investors are likely disappointed that Apple has yet to resume its practice of providing guidance.</strong> We figured that with a new fiscal year getting underway, perhaps Apple would start guiding again. Apple's decision to continue not providing guidance may be weighing on the stock. </li><li> <strong>Retail investors have found other shiny new objects to play with.</strong> The massive short squeezes in GME, AMC, and others seem to be siphoning interest/headlines away from Apple's strong results. </li><li><strong>It's a bit of sell-the-news reaction </strong>given Apple's +22% surge since Thanksgiving. Everyone knew it'd be a strong quarter given the iPhone launch, and the report is being seen as an opportunity to book some profits. </li></ul><p>Overall, this was a great quarter for Apple despite the stock's reaction today. The iPhone 12 launch was a big success. In most years, new iPhone models include just incremental improvements, like better chips or superior cameras. This year was a big step up, as Apple finally launched its long-awaited 5G iPhone. However, Mac sales coming in a bit light and a lack of guidance is causing investors to cash in on recent gains.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
