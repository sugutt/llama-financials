<html><body><p><strong>Microsoft (MSFT +2%)</strong> reportedly is chatting it up with Discord, an online chat platform popular with video game communities, according to <a bhref="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-23/microsoft-said-to-be-in-talks-to-buy-discord-for-more-than-10b?srnd=premium&amp;sref=QY7kFAuy" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>. The article says Discord has been talking to several potential buyers, but no deal is imminent. Discord has a free service that lets gamers and other users communicate by video, voice, and text, according to the article, but MSFT might be looking to bundle Discord's premium offering, Nitro, into its Game Pass service to drive subscription revenue. </p><p> <strong>Briefing.com's take on a potential deal:</strong> </p><ul><li>A deal like this might strike some investors as odd. Microsoft has been focused mostly on enterprise corporate clients. While it has exposure on the consumer side with its popular Xbox, Minecraft, and Surface businesses, MSFT does not really have much exposure on the social media front. Granted, Discord is not precisely social media, but its chat format bears resemblance to other social platforms. </li><li>Recall that Microsoft expressed interest in acquiring TikTok last August and also in acquiring <strong>Pinterest (PINS)</strong> in early 2021, according to FT.com. A deal for Discord would be much smaller, but it shows a real desire from MSFT to want to engage more deeply with consumers. </li><li>The article mentions a potential $10 bln price, which would be a quite small deal for MSFT - much smaller than other deals it was exploring. </li><li> We do not think the timing is a coincidence after MSFT launched its long-awaited new gaming console last November: Xbox Series X and Series S. The launch was Xbox's most successful ever. Gaming is as popular now as it's ever been, fueled by people spending more time at home. </li><li>Xbox already has a large and growing consumer subscription business. However, the deal would really bolster Xbox's subscription revenue. Xbox Live has more than 100 mln monthly active users, while Game Pass now has 18 mln subscribers. Bundling in Nitro would add a nice boost to subscription revenue as it'd be an easy upsell to Xbox's huge existing user base. </li><li> Xbox users can use Discord already, but Microsoft owning the platform would really allow Xbox to build it into its ecosystem. </li></ul><p>Overall, we think it's just a matter of time before Microsoft makes a big splash on the social media front, particularly given that MSFT's interest in Discord reportedly follows consideration of TikTok and Pinterest. Clearly, the company wants to tap into a platform with deep engagement with consumers. All we can say is do not underestimate Microsoft. Recall that it was once criticized for focusing too much on software loaded on PCs and was late to the game on cloud computing. However, its Azure cloud computing service is now a powerhouse.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
