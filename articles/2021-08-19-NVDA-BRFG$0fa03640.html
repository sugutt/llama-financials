<html><body><p><strong>NVIDIA (NVDA +1%) </strong>is seeing a muted reaction to its stock today despite beating on Q2 (Jul) earnings and revs. The supplier of graphics chips to many different industries also issued upside guidance for Q3 (Oct), despite seeing a minimal contribution from cryptocurrency mining processors (CMPs) moving forward. </p><p> Despite CMP revenue coming in at $266 mln, well below NVDA's original $400 mln estimate, its Gaming, Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Automotive segments remain hot. Also, NVDA expects demand for its chips in these segments to outpace supply for the vast majority of next year. </p><ul><li> Nonetheless, the stock has been up and down today. Although NVDA continued to post impressive revenue growth of over 35% across each of its four main segments, its $0.02 earnings beat snapped a streak of seven consecutive double-digit earnings beats. Furthermore, NVDA's earnings of $1.04 per share are its lowest since 1Q19. In addition, we think investors are becoming more concerned about frothy valuations. NVDA trades at 48x forward earnings, pegging the company at a premium over competitors AMD (AMD, 41x forward earnings) and Intel (INTC, 10.9x forward earnings). </li><li> However, there were still many bright spots in Q2. Every segment but Automotive set new revenue records, driving total revenue growth to 68% yr/yr to $6.51 bln. Professional Visualization led, more than doubling at 156% yr/yr and jumping 40% sequentially to $519 mln. This segment is starting to gain a lot of traction, especially as talk of the "metaverse" heats up. For example, NVDA's Omniverse platform, its real-time simulation and collaboration platform that provides the foundation of the metaverse, has now seen over 50,000 creators downloading the platform since it launched in December. With companies such as <strong>Facebook (FB)</strong> and <strong>Roblox (RBLX) </strong>pouring resources into shaping this virtual world, we think the metaverse could become a significant revenue component for NVDA going forward. </li><li>In Gaming, revenue grew 85% yr/yr and 11% sequentially to $3.06 bln. NVDA stated that it has difficulty quantifying crypto's effect on its gaming revenue, as its GPUs can be used to mine cryptocurrency. However, we think NVDA's technological advantage in graphics processing over its competitors positions the company for continued gains even if the crypto market were to fall, especially as the pandemic ignited a greater shift toward gaming. </li><li>Data Center growth yr/yr did cool off in Q2, growing 35% yr/yr to $2.37 bln after increasing 79% in Q1. However, Data Center revenue was lapping one of its biggest gains last year when revs rocketed 167%. Again, we think NVDA's GPU technology in this space is ahead of the competition, given that its Data Center revs of $2.37 bln are greater than AMD's Computing and Graphics segment (which includes its gaming and data center revenue) of $2.25 bln. </li><li>Finally, Automotive was the laggard in Q2, growing 37% yr/yr but falling 1% sequentially to $152 mln. We remain bullish on NVDA's automotive segment and believe it can be a significant catalyst as the automotive industry moves increasingly toward autonomous driving and more complex infotainment systems. </li></ul><p>Overall, despite not being reflected in the price action today, NVDA's Q2 performance and its outlook on its many businesses demonstrated why it is considered a top-flight growth name in the semiconductor industry. We are not overly concerned about NVDA's bearish view on cryptocurrency mining, especially as NVDA remains a leader in many other industries where the company's focus lies. We think pullbacks in the stock can act as nice entry points for buy-and-hold investors.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
