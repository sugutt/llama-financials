<html><body><p>There is some big M&amp;A action in the semiconductor space today as <strong>Nvidia (NVDA +7%) </strong><a bhref="https://www.briefing.com/InPlayEq/NewsFeed/newsdoc?id=696872" target="_blank">announced</a> a deal to acquire Arm Limited from Softbank for $40 bln in cash and stock. SoftBank will get an ownership stake in NVIDIA, expected to be under 10%. At first, this may seem like an odd combination but it makes sense when one digs into it. </p><p>NVDA is known for making graphics chips for videogames, but it's real sweet spot is its data center chips. Its data center segment is seeing booming demand and the recent shift to at-home work/learning is fueling this segment even more. NVDA is also very involved in artificial intelligence (AI) and automation applications. </p><p>Arm Holdings is a bit different. Arm is not a manufacturing company. It's more of a neutral designer of chips and it licenses its technology to a wide variety of semiconductor companies who then build chips using Arm's designs. Arm's technologies are used in everything from sensors to smartphones to supercomputers. The company's designs power roughly 90% of all smartphones. </p><p>The combination brings together NVDA's AI computing platform with the vast ecosystem of Arm's CPU. NVDA says the combination will turbocharge Arm's R&amp;D capacity and expand Arm's IP portfolio with NVDA's GPU and AI technology. In the years ahead, trillions of computers running AI will create a new internet-of-things that is thousands of times larger than today's internet-of-people, according to NVDA. </p><p>There could be some troubles ahead. </p><ul><li> Arm is known as a neutral provider of technology and Arm's current licensees may not be too thrilled with a competitor owning Arm. <ul><li> NVDA counters this by saying Arm will continue to operate its open-licensing model, it will maintain its customer neutrality and Arm will maintain its name while continuing to be based in the UK. </li><li> However, this could cause some uneasiness going forward. </li></ul></li><li> This deal could face regulatory hurdles as both the US and China will need to sign off on the transaction. <ul><li> With US-China tensions running high and with the US recently blocking <strong>Broadcom's (AVGO)</strong> bid for <strong>Qualcomm (QCOM)</strong>, China may not approve the deal. </li></ul></li></ul><p>Based on the stock reaction today, it's clear that NVDA shareholders are excited about this deal. Assuming the deal goes through and it's not a slam dunk, NVDA would gain massive exposure to the smartphone market and a deal would open up a world of new applications for the company's AI technology.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
