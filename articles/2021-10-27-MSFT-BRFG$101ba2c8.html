<html><body><p><strong>Microsoft (MSFT +5%)</strong> is very "LinkedIn" after the software giant kicked off FY22 with another big EPS beat for Q1 (Sep) at $0.19. Revenue grew 22% yr/yr to $45.32 bln, which also was better than expected. Revenue growth had been in the low-to-mid-teens from 2018-20 but has accelerated to 20+% in each of the past two quarters. Typically, as companies get larger, growth gets harder to come by, but MSFT is stepping on the gas. <strong>It's truly remarkable that a company this large can do that.</strong> </p><p>The company makes the argument that digital technology is a deflationary force in an inflationary economy. Businesses can improve productivity and the affordability of their products and services by building up tech intensity. Given the company's revenue acceleration, it's clear that businesses are buying into this idea. Microsoft Cloud grew 36% yr/yr to $20.7 bln, its first-ever $20+ bln quarter. </p><p>Before digging into the segments, investors should be aware that Windows 11 launched in early October, constituting the operating system's biggest update in a decade. MSFT believes that the pandemic has led to a structural shift in PC demand, and early response to Windows 11 has been great. Better data should come in Q2 (Dec) as MSFT will launch Windows 11 in new PCs beginning this holiday season. </p><ul><li> <strong>Intelligent Cloud (IC)</strong> was by far the fastest growing segment, with revenue up 31% yr/yr to $17.0 bln vs prior guidance of $16.40-16.65 bln, driven by continued customer demand for hybrid and cloud offerings. Growth was fueled by Azure at 50% yr/yr, which was right in-line with growth posted in recent quarters: 51% in JunQ and 50% in MarQ. MSFT expects Azure to remain healthy in DecQ, consistent with recent trends. </li><li>The <strong>Productivity and Business Processes (PBP) </strong>segment did well also, with revs up 22% to $15.0 bln vs prior guidance of $14.50-14.75 bln, with better-than-expected performances in Office Commercial and LinkedIn. MSFT is seeing record engagement with LinkedIn due to the "Great Reshuffle", as large numbers of workers seek new job opportunities. </li><li>The <strong>More Personal Computing (MPC) </strong>segment was a bit of a laggard; revs rose 12% to $13.30 bln vs prior guidance of $12.40-12.80 bln. MSFT saw a good performance in Windows OEM, driven by a stronger-than-expected PC market, particularly in the Commercial segment, and Gaming. </li><li> <strong>In its commercial business, Microsoft Cloud and Azure led the way.</strong> MSFT also saw increased usage across Teams and Power Platform. On the consumer side, Windows OEM performance was better than expected in a growing PC market, despite ongoing supply chain constraints. MSFT also saw positive demand signals for Windows 11 ahead of the launch, with nearly all devices built this quarter eligible for an upgrade. </li><li><strong>Finally, in gaming topics, </strong>MSFT did not even address Netflix's move into gaming. We do not get the sense MSFT is worried at all. In the Q2 holiday season, MSFT expects revenue growth in the high-single digits. Console sales will continue to be impacted by supply chain uncertainty. For Xbox content and services, MSFT expects revenue growth in the mid-teens with strong engagement on the Xbox platform in a holiday quarter that will include several AAA title launches. </li></ul><p><strong>Bottom line, most everyone was expecting a big quarter from Microsoft, and we got it.</strong> Also, the company sounds bullish heading into the holiday DecQ period. As if PC demand needed any further boosters, the launch of Windows 11 should help fuel sales this holiday season even more. Maybe the one chink in the armor is Surface sales slowing, but MSFT was both lapping a huge quarter and facing supply chain issues. We also were fearful of a sell-the-news reaction given the stock's recent gains (+22% since early June), but to our surprise, investors are shrugging off those concerns. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
