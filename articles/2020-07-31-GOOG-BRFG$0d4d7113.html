<html><body><p>The headline Q2 numbers for <strong>Alphabet</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>) look solid on the surface after the tech giant topped analysts' EPS and revenue expectations. The company generated EPS of $10.13, comfortably exceeding the $8.23 consensus estimate, on revenue of $38.3 bln compared to the $37.3 bln expectation.<br><br> Those expectations, though, forecasted EPS to plummet by 42% yr/yr. While GOOG managed to handily beat that bleak projection, EPS still fell by 29% and revenue dipped lower by 2%, marking the first ever yr/yr top-line drop for GOOG.<br><br> During GOOG's Q1 earnings conference call on April 28, CFO Ruth Porat commented that Q2 will be difficult due to the drop-off in advertising spending. That prediction came to fruition as advertising revenue fell by 8% to $29.87 bln.<br><br> The pandemic wreaked havoc on the economy in Q2, as illustrated by the 32.9% nose-dive in GDP for the quarter. When the economy struggles, advertising spending is typically one of the first areas that companies pull back on, as illustrated by the decline in GOOG's ad revenue.<br><br> GOOG had a more difficult time retaining advertising spending than <strong>Facebook </strong>(<strong>FB</strong>), which reported a 10% increase in advertising revenue for Q2. The weaker performance for GOOG could be due to its heavy reliance on smaller and medium-sized businesses, some of which may not have the resources to withstand the economic fallout from the pandemic.<br><br> On the positive side, CEO Sundar Pichai stated that the company saw early signs of stabilization across most verticals as users returned to commercial activity. Consequently, yr/yr search revenue trends improved during the quarter with search revenues essentially flat by the end of June.<br><br> Despite the improvement, Pichai remained cautious, adding that the global economic environment is fragile. <br><br> While GOOG's ad business struggles to regain momentum, there are other notable pockets of strength throughout the company.</p><ul><li>For instance, Google Cloud revenue jumped by 43% to $3.0 bln. Encouragingly, GOOG said it is gaining traction with larger customers who are signing multi-year contracts with the company. This is evidenced by its substantial backlog, which amounted to $14.8 bln at the end of the quarter.</li><li>YouTube and Google Play were two other areas of strength. Advertising revenue on YouTube climbed by 6% to $3.8 bln and the Google Play app experienced a 35% yr/yr increase in game downloads. The solid performance in both of these businesses can mainly be tied to people staying at home who are looking for information and entertainment options.</li></ul><p>The stronger results from GOOG's other businesses (Cloud, YouTube, Play) helped the company outperform Q2 expectations. The bar for GOOG to hurdle was set very low, taking some of the luster off the company's upside results. The main question moving forward is whether the positive trends seen in GOOG's core ad business will continue into 2H20. The answer to that question rests on the global economy, which remains shaky and uncertain.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
