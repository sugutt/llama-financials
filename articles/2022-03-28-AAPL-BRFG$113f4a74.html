<html><body><p>Shares of <strong>Apple (AAPL)</strong> are holding up today despite a report by <em>Nikkei </em> indicating that the company is looking to reduce the production of its iPhone SE by two to three million units. The entry-level iPhone was launched on March 18 in numerous countries, including the US, the UK, India, and China. Additionally, AAPL is reportedly cutting AirPods production by over 10 mln units for the year. The reports cites that AAPL is slashing production due to softening demand, driven partly by souring consumer sentiment due to inflationary uncertainties. </p><p>AAPL does not split out sales for iPhone models in its quarterly financial results, instead just grouping totals for all models under iPhone revenue. However, cutting two to three million units is not massive relative to the over 80 mln total iPhones shipped in Q1 (Dec). Therefore, even though the SE picks up many sales in emerging markets, as its price point fits more competitively in those regions, the reduced production is not a massive loss. At the same time, trimming AirPods production by 10 mln units may also not come as a significant loss. In FY21, it is estimated that AAPL sold over 75 mln AirPods. </p><p>However, the reported reasoning is more concerning, as inflationary pressures could take a bite out of sales this year. </p><ul><li>AAPL's new product iterations tend to be relatively minor each year, which may not spur as much upgrade demand as the company anticipates if inflation remains at the top of consumers' minds. For example, the latest model of the iPhone, the company's highest revenue-generating product by far at $71.6 bln last quarter (~58% of total sales), essentially only received a slight bump in its processor, incrementally better cameras, and a brighter screen relative to the previous generation. </li><li> Entry-level products may not be AAPL's top sellers, but they play an important role in attracting new customers into its ecosystem. Although the production cut is slim given the scope of AAPL's overall units shipped, it could still lead to fewer sales for other products, such as iPads and Macs. </li><li>Speaking of which, one of the trouble areas in Q1 was iPad sales; iPad was the only category outside Services that missed estimates. AAPL noted that supply constraints contributed to the slower-than-expected sales growth. Even though supply is set to pick up throughout the year, an iPad is considered a more discretionary purchase than is an iPhone or a Mac, as it performs only some functions of each, making it not as essential as a phone or computer. As a result, its sales may be further impacted by inflationary pressures. </li></ul><p> Overall, investors are not overreacting to today's reports of iPhone SE and AirPods production cuts. We do not think that selling fewer iPhone SEs and AirPods will significantly impact sales in the coming quarters. However, a shift in consumer sentiment away from upgrading electronics due to rampant price inflation would present a more dire situation. Still, phone carriers' subsidies for upgrades and the sheer magnitude of AAPL's global footprint should provide a cushion against a potential inflation-driven slowdown in demand. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
