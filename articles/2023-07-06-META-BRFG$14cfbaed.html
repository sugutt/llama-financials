<html><body><p>Mark Zuckerberg's "year of efficiency" has been a rousing success as far as investors are concerned with <strong>Meta Platform </strong>(<strong>META</strong>)  skyrocketing by over 230% since last November's lows. Now, instead of implementing massive cost-cutting measures that include more than 21,000 layoffs, Mr. Zuckerberg is hoping that the launch of a new Twitter-like app can provide a top-line catalyst that boosts its ad revenue while providing more steam to this rally.</p><ul><li>Last night, META officially introduced Threads, an app for posting text updates that was created by the Instagram team. Similar to Twitter, Threads has a character limit -- posts can be up to 500 characters long -- and can include photos, links, and videos. </li><li>A key factor in META's mission to become a major competitive threat to Twitter is that it can draw directly from Instagram's pool of over 2.3 bln users. Simply by having an Instagram account, users can access and post on Thread, helping to explain how the app already has 10.0 mln sign ups in just seven hours, according to Mr. Zuckerberg.</li></ul><p>It's no secret that Twitter is also in a vulnerable position. To say that it's been a tumultuous time since Elon Musk closed on his $44 bln acquisition of Twitter in October 2022 would be an understatement. </p><ul><li>Users and advertisers have fled the social media platform due to both technical issues on the platform and Musk's contentious personality and controversial views on certain matters. </li><li>To put these problems into perspective, Musk reported in March that Twitter's advertising revenue had plunged by about 50%.</li></ul><p>There's no guarantee that Threads will become profitable, even if it does significantly cut into Twitter's market share. However, unlike the company's metaverse ambitions, META already has most of the infrastructure and workforce in place to roll out Threads to millions of users. </p><ul><li>This is reflected by the fact that META lowered its FY23 expense guidance to $86-$90 bln from $86-$92 bln, while keeping its capex forecast unchanged at $30-$33 bln, when it reported Q1 earnings in late April.</li><li>It's worth noting, though, that Threads is launching without ads since the priority at this time is to build critical mass. Like Reels -- META's short format video app -- it could take some time before Thread's monetization efficiency is at a solid place. META's investments in AI should help to speed up that process. <ul><li>Last quarter, META reported that AI powered a 24% increase in time spend on Instagram.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The main takeaway is that META is taking a big swing at Twitter and thanks to the company's huge built-in user base it has a legitimate shot at grabbing significant market share. Furthermore, unlike META's very costly metaverse plans, the development, launch, and expansion of Threads shouldn't substantially weigh on profits.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
