<html><body><p><strong>Apple (AAPL -6%) </strong>fell a little far from the tree today as the company wrapped up FY20 on a bit of a sour note. The headline numbers were not bad with Apple <a bhref="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/FY20_Q4_Consolidated_Financial_Statements.pdf" target="_blank">reporting</a> Q4 (Sep) non-GAAP EPS of $0.73, a $0.03 beat while revenue rose 1.0% yr/yr to $64.7 bln, slightly better than expected. </p><p> However, following a $0.51 beat in JunQ and four consecutive $0.20+ EPS beats, the $0.03 upside looks pretty pedestrian. Also, the company did not feel comfortable providing Q1 (Dec) guidance, which was unfortunate given that the iPhone 12 (Apple's first 5G phone) is launching this quarter. However, Apple did not provide guidance last quarter either, so it would have been an even bigger surprise if the company provided guidance. </p><ul><li>The biggest disappointment was iPhone sales falling 21% yr/yr to $26.44 bln, a good bit below the $28.5 bln ests.  <ul><li>However, we would not fret too much over this because this year Apple launched new iPhone models in October, a few weeks later than last year's mid-September launch.  <ul><li>Up to that mid-September point, Apple says customer demand for iPhone was very strong and grew double digits. </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Apple performed very well across its bevy of non-iPhone offerings with strong double-digit growth despite supply constraints in several product categories: <ul><li> iPad revs of $6.80 bln (+46% yr/yr) vs. $6.20 ests;</li><li>Wearables of $7.88 bln (+21% yr/yr) vs. $7.6 bln ests;</li><li> Mac revs of $9.03 bln (+29% yr/yr);</li><li>Services of $14.55 bln (+16% yr/yr).</li></ul></li><li> Apple is benefitting from the shift to at-home work/school, which has pushed people to buy new products, apps, and services. <ul><li> In a typical year, the back-to-school season is a bustling time for Apple, but it was even stronger than normal this year. </li></ul></li></ul><p>While the small EPS beat and light iPhone sales are mostly to blame for the pullback in the stock today, investors should take heart that nearly every other product category saw robust demand. The iPhone shortfall was understandable given the delayed launch. Looking ahead, all eyes will be on DecQ sales for its iPhone 12 launch. Even without guidance, it's safe to assume there will be huge demand for the first 5G phones. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
