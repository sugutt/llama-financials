<html><body><p>After three consecutive quarters of yr/yr revenue declines, <strong>Meta Platforms</strong> (<strong>META</strong>) returned to positive top-line growth in 1Q23 while it slashed costs, leading to a strong earnings report that's catapulting shares to their highest levels since early February of 2022. The stock's surge, which is also bolstering the broader stock market's gains, is also a function of META's pleasing outlook for Q2.</p><ul><li>Over the past six quarters, META either issued inline or downside revenue guidance for the quarter ahead, but META ended that losing streak last night with its upside 2Q23 revenue guidance.</li><li>Importantly, that revenue forecast of $29.5-$32.0 bln suggests that growth could accelerate to as high as 10% following this quarter's 2.6% increase, indicating that advertising demand is thawing, and that META has slowed or halted TikTok's momentum.</li><li>When <strong>Google</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>) posted better-than-expected Q1 results on Tuesday night that included flat advertising revenue after back-to-back yr/yr declines, a significant piece of evidence pointing to a stabilization of demand was provided. META's results offered some confirmation of that assertion as its ad impressions jumped by 26% in Q1.</li></ul><p>It's not only the healthier digital advertising environment that's fueling META's return to growth.</p><ul><li>During the earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg called out the company's emerging AI capabilities as a key factor behind the rebound. Specifically, META is using AI to identify the best short-form videos to distribute in its Reels platform, which is improving monetization. </li><li>He added that Reels monetization efficiency is up by more than 30% on Instagram and up over 40% on Facebook on a sequential basis. Furthermore, AI has powered a 24% increase in time spend on Instagram.</li></ul><p>These are encouraging data points that really ease the competitive and sinking ad demand concerns, but there is a caveat: namely, META is lapping easier yr/yr comparisons. In the year-earlier period, revenue was up by only 6.5%, and it gets even easier over the rest of the year as META laps a 0.9% decrease in Q2, followed by declines of 4.5% in Q3 and Q4.&nbsp;<br><br>Still, it's clear that business is improving for META in this "year of efficiency." </p><ul><li>That moniker, which was coined by Mr. Zuckerberg, has essentially equated to mass layoffs across the company.&nbsp;Following a round of 11,000 layoffs that were announced last year, META disclosed that it was planning to layoff 10,000 more employees in March.</li><li>As of March 31, 2023, META had completed most of the 2022 layoffs, but there are more cuts on the horizon. There is one more wave of layoffs coming, which should be completed in April and May. </li><li>Perhaps as important as the upside revenue guidance, META also once again lowered its FY23 expense guidance, forecasting $86-$90 bln in expenses vs. its prior guidance of $86-$92 bln. For some perspective on META's cost-cutting efforts, the company originally planned on expenses of $94-$100 bln when it issued 3Q22 results last October.</li></ul><p>The main takeaway is that META delivered exactly what investors wanted to see. It checked off all the boxes: stabilizing/improving digital ad space; significant progress in its AI development, another reduction in expense guidance, and improving monetization of Reels.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
