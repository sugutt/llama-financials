<html><body><p>Given that competitor <strong>Advanced Micro (AMD)</strong> had raised the bar earlier this month with its double-digit Q1 EPS beat and bullish Q2 predictions, <strong>NVIDIA's (NVDA +3%)</strong> single-digit earnings upside for Q1 (Apr) and downbeat Q2 (Jul) revenue guidance, announced after the close yesterday, did not initially stir up much enthusiasm. This could be due in part to NVDA's relatively high multiple of 29x forward earnings, a premium compared to AMD at 20x. </p><p> However, with NVDA shares having tumbled over 40% on the year, <strong>its weak points from Q1 may have been priced in.</strong> Furthermore, <strong>NVDA would have exceeded analysts' Q2 revenue expectations</strong> if not for factors outside its control. Also, <strong>the company increased its share repurchase program</strong> to $15 bln through December 2023, signaling that management views the stock as currently undervalued. </p><ul><li>The most glaring negative from NVDA's AprQ earnings report was its bearish quarterly revs guidance, which came in below consensus for the first time since 4Q20 (Jan). NVDA expects JulQ sales of $7.94-8.26 bln, translating to just 24.5% growth yr/yr and marking its slowest quarter of growth in over two years. <ul><li> The lockdowns in China are a culprit, as is demand softness in parts of Europe brought about by the war in Ukraine. NVDA anticipates that those will deal a negative impact of roughly $500 mln to JulQ revs. Drilling deeper, the company anticipates lower sell-through in Russia and China, negatively affecting its JulQ Gaming revs by $400 mln. Meanwhile, foregoing sales to Russia is expected to take a $100 mln bite out of JulQ Data Center revs. </li></ul></li><li>However, one of NVDA's primary suppliers, <strong>Samsung (SSNLF),</strong> cautioned in late April that overall mobile demand was cooling off from the crisis in Ukraine and China's lockdowns. Also, back in late March, another supplier, <strong>Micron (MU)</strong>, noted that production at one of its China facilities took a hit from lockdowns. Therefore, investors may have already suspected that NVDA had a challenging quarter ahead. </li><li> NVDA also demonstrated its technological dominance in Q1, highlighted by its 47% adjusted EPS growth and 46% revenue growth yr/yr. Outside of Automotive, NVDA's segments exhibited strong growth in the quarter, with Data Center and Gaming continuing to set quarterly sales records. <ul><li> Data Center revs grew 83% yr/yr and 15% sequentially to $3.75 bln. Sales from hyperscale and cloud computing customers, like <strong>Microsoft (MSFT)</strong> and <strong>Amazon (AMZN)</strong>, more than doubled from last year. NVDA also noted that its customer base is adding capacity to keep pace with demand, boding well for continual Data Center growth going forward. </li><li>Gaming revs jumped 31% yr/yr and 6% sequentially to $3.62 bln, fueled by robust laptop gaming sales. Since AMD and <strong>Intel (INTC)</strong> commented that the PC market decelerated in Q1 from the near-record shipments notched during the height of the pandemic, it was encouraging to see NVDA report strong laptop demand. NVDA supplies graphics chips needed for gaming, helping to sustain its PC demand, as it caters to a different market than AMD and INTC, which provide chips for a much broader audience.</li></ul></li></ul><p> Bottom line, after enduring a brief sell-off to start the trading session today, NVDA is roaring back as the smoke generated by its headline downbeat Q2 guidance clears. Lastly, as shares are still trading at half price from record highs set in November, and as management is looking to retire over 3% of outstanding shares within the next 19 months, NVDA remains a solid choice for buy-and-hold investors.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
