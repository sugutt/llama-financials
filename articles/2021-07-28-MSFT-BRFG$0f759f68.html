<html><body><p><strong>Microsoft's (MSFT +1%)</strong> earnings report last night was very "Linked In". The software giant closed out FY21 with another big EPS beat in Q4 (Jun) at $0.25. It's really remarkable that a company this large can post 21.3% yr/yr revenue growth at $46.15 bln, also surpassing expections. Microsoft is seeing revenue growth across industries, customer segments, and geographies; over 50% of its sales are coming from outside the US. </p><p>Before digging into the segments, investors should be aware that the upcoming launch of Windows 11 is being described by MSFT as the biggest update to its operating system in a decade. It's reimagining everything from the Windows platform to the store, and early feedback has been positive. MSFT will launch Windows 11 in new PCs beginning this holiday season. </p><ul><li>In its Commercial business, MSFT is seeing healthy demand for its hybrid and cloud offerings, which drove significant growth in the number of $10+ mln Azure and Microsoft 365 contracts. </li><li> Within its IC segment, server products and cloud services revenue increased 34% yr/yr vs 26% growth in MarQ, driven by <strong>Azure revenue growth of 51% yr/yr vs 50% growth in MarQ</strong>, 50% growth in DecQ, and 48% growth in SepQ. MSFT also said it expects Azure to remain stable sequentially in SepQ. Azure growth remains impressive and raises the bar for <strong>Amazon's (AMZN)</strong> AWS when it reports tomorrow after the bell. </li><li><strong>Customer reliance on Microsoft Cloud drove sequential increases</strong> in usage across Teams, Power Platform, and its security and identity offerings, which are helping companies shift to hybrid work models. </li><li> <strong>LinkedIn was a real bright spot:</strong> revs grew 46% yr/yr vs 25% growth in MarQ, fueled by an improving job market, which drove strength in annual contracts and job postings. </li><li> <strong>In its Consumer business, Windows OEM and Surface were impacted by ongoing supply chain constraints.</strong> Meanwhile, Search and LinkedIn were supported by an improved advertising climate. </li><li> Strong engagement supported results in the Gaming category while demand for Xbox Series X and S consoles continued to exceed supply. In further Gaming topics, <strong>MSFT did not even address Netflix's (NFLX) move into gaming. We do not get the sense MSFT is worried at all. </strong>Unlike streaming TV, which was a wide open field when NFLX pioneered there, game streaming/subscription already has several huge players, including Xbox and PlayStation. Both already offer gaming subscriptions. Also, NFLX initially is limiting itself to mobile gaming, which presents less immediate threat to console gaming. </li></ul><p>Bottom line, most everyone was expecting a big quarter from Microsoft, and we got it. We had concerns that MSFT's comments on Surface sales being expected to decline in the low teens in SepQ as it works through supply chain challenges could weigh on the stock heading into what should be a robust back-to-school season. We also were fearful of a sell-the-news reaction given the recent move in the stock (+17% since early June), but to our surprise, investors are shrugging off those concerns.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
