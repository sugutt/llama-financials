<html><body><p>There is always one bad <strong>Apple (AAPL -4%)</strong> in every bunch. While Apple normally reports great earnings every quarter, the company last night closed out FY21 with a bit of a stinker. </p><ul><li> <strong>The headline numbers were neither awful nor great</strong> for Q4 (Sep) as the company showed that even it is not immune from supply constraint pressures. Apple reported in-line EPS, which, given the company's sterling track record for big beats, is something of a letdown. Furthermore, the quarter's revenue, despite being a SepQ record, was light of consensus for the first time since MarQ2017. </li><li><strong>Demand is not an issue; </strong>in fact, Apple described demand as robust in SepQ. The quarter's main challenge was larger than expected supply constraints. Apple estimates that these constraints had a $6 bln revenue impact, driven primarily by industry-wide silicon shortages and COVID-related manufacturing disruptions. Nevertheless, Apple set an all-time record for Mac sales and quarterly records for iPhone, iPad, Wearables, Home and Accessories, representing 30% yr/yr growth in products. Its Services business outperformed internal expectations, achieving an all-time record of $18.3 bln, up 26% yr/yr. </li><li><strong>iPhone revenue jumped 47% yr/yr to $38.9 bln but was light of consensus. </strong>Just as iPhone 12 was more of a DecQ story last year, so will iPhone 13 be this year due to supply constraints. Meanwhile, Wearables and Mac sales also were light. The only category to beat expectations was iPad; Services were in-line. </li><li><strong>These weak results were not entirely a surprise.</strong> Apple warned about component shortages during its earnings call in late July, saying that supply constraints during SepQ would likely be greater than JunQ, with the constraints primarily impacting iPhone and iPad. A Bloomberg article a few weeks ago said that Apple was likely to slash iPhone 13 production targets due to chip shortages. </li><li><strong>What is a surprise is the greater-than-expected severity</strong> of the supply issues; furthermore, Apple said during the Q&amp;A that constraints will cause a larger hit to Q1 (Dec) revs than the $6 bln experienced in SepQ. </li></ul><p><strong>Bottom line, this report shows that even a tech behemoth like Apple is not immune</strong> from the global chip shortage. The timing of the shortage is unfortunate, as it's coming just as Apple introduced its iPhone 13 lineup as well as the Apple Watch Series 7, new iPad, and iPad mini, all of which represent significant advances. It's also bad news for Apple suppliers like <strong>SWKS, QRVO, CRUS, AVGO, TSM, QCOM, SMH, LPL, LITE, FNSR</strong>, and <strong>IIVI</strong>. Based on Apple's comments and those of many others, investors should be prepared for this chip shortage issue to linger for some time.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
