<html><body><p>High inventory levels across the consumer electronics space, a slowdown in enterprise IT spending, and macroeconomic uncertainties have plagued the semiconductor industry, but <strong>NVIDIA's</strong> (<strong>NVDA</strong>) beat-and-raise Q4 earnings report is brightening the gloomy sentiment today.</p><ul><li>Last quarter, NVDA predicted that its PC-centric gaming segment (~30% of Q4 revenue) would see a rebound in Q4 as channel inventory levels continue to correct. That forecast came to fruition with gaming revenue increasing by 16% sequentially to $1.83 bln, handily beating analysts' estimates. </li><li>Although NVDA may have been more proficient than other chip makers in managing the supply and demand imbalance by significantly reducing shipments in Q2 and Q3, the qtr/qtr improvement still signals that the worst of the correction may be over. That's good news for companies like <strong>Advanced Micro Devices</strong> (<strong>AMD</strong>),<strong> Intel</strong> (<strong>INTC</strong>), and <strong>Micron</strong> (<strong>MU</strong>).</li><li>After jumping by 31% in Q3, revenue in NVDA's Data Center segment grew at a much more modest pace in Q4, increasing by 11% yr/yr to $3.62 bln, missing expectations. Persistent weakness in China -- NVDA's second largest market -- has weighed on sales of the company's graphic processing units (GPUs). However, NVDA is anticipating an acceleration of growth for Data Center this fiscal year as China's economy reopens and as hyperscalers continue to ramp up their investments.</li></ul><p>These are encouraging data points for the semiconductor industry overall, but NVDA looks poised to outperform the field for the foreseeable future.</p><ul><li>The company's superior growth prospects are tied to the substantial investments it has made in AI-powered technology over the past several years. During last night's earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang commented that AI adoption is at an inflection point as the company prepares to launch new cloud-based AI products.</li><li>Specifically, NVDA's new AI supercomputer, which runs on its H100 GPU, is now in full&nbsp;production. The company's strategy is to offer AI-as-a-Service to enterprises, enabling them to deploy large language models and other AI workflows. </li><li>Working in NVDA's favor is the fact that GPUs are a natural fit for powering the kind of high-level computing that's involved in AI, including for chat bots like OpenAI's ChatGPT. By far, NVDA is the global leader in the GPU market with a share greater than 75%.</li><li>NVDA's dominance in GPUs and the emergence of AI technology bodes very well for its Data Center segment as demand for its H100 processor accelerates and as it expands its AI cloud service. On the latter point, NVDA is partnering with cloud computing giants like <strong>Microsoft </strong>(<strong>MSFT</strong>) and <strong>Google</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>) to enable customers to access its AI platform via a browser.</li></ul><p>Along with the improving gaming climate, this building momentum in the Data Center segment underpinned NVDA's upside Q1 revenue guidance. The future does indeed look very bright for NVDA, which is distancing itself from other chip makers thanks to its AI-based growth prospects.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
