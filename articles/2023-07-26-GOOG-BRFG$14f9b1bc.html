<html><body><p><strong>Alphabet</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>) may not have knocked it out of the park with its 2Q23 results, but the Google parent company has now beat EPS and revenue expectations in back-to-back quarters, illustrating that the rebound in its advertising business is strengthening. Following a rough stretch in 2H22 and early 2023 in which companies reined in advertising spending, it's apparent that budgets have loosened up and that GOOG's search product is still a favored choice among marketers, even as AI-powered competition heats up.</p><ul><li>Search, GOOG's bread-and-butter business, grew revenue by nearly 5% yr/yr to $42.6 bln, edging past estimates. While the growth doesn't seem overly impressive, the key takeaway is that the trend is moving in the right direction. After decreasing by 1.6% in Q4, search revenue increased by 2% in Q1, and the momentum continued into Q2.</li><li>With the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT last November, and the subsequent frenzy that surrounded it, concerns began to surface that GOOG's search business could become vulnerable to market share losses. <strong>Microsoft's</strong> (<strong>MSFT</strong>) Bing search engine, for instance, has added new AI-powered chat tools in an effort to increase its competitiveness and lure in more advertisers.</li><li>Although it's still early, so far there's little evidence to suggest that GOOG's dominance in search is waning. Furthermore, the company is busy developing its own AI-based features for its search engine which will be rolled out in the coming quarters.&nbsp;</li><li>Rising competition has taken a toll, though, on  YouTube. The emergence of TikTok, combined with a pullback in advertising spending, has weighed on YouTube, as reflected by revenue decreases of 3% and 8% in Q1 and Q4, respectively. However, YouTube also bounced back in Q1 as revenue edged higher by 4.4% to $7.66 bln, beating expectations. <ul><li>Additionally, momentum continues to build for YouTube Shorts -- GOOG's answer to TikTok's short format videos -- as monthly users climbed to over 2.0 bln compared to 1.5 bln a year ago.</li></ul></li><li>Meanwhile, Google Cloud's transition to profitability reached a new level with operating income increasing to $395 mln from $191 mln in Q1. Recall that last quarter was the first profitable quarter for Cloud. Revenue growth remained steady at 27% compared to 28% in Q1, while GOOG's cost-cutting efforts are also likely boosting Cloud's margins.</li></ul><p>Now that GOOG's core advertising business has steadied and improved, and Cloud has turned the corner and is generating profits, the company is in a stronger position to make a significant leadership change. On that note, the company also announced last night that  CFO Ruth Porat will assume the newly created role of President and Chief Investment Officer. She will continue to serve as CFO until a permanent replacement has been named.<br><br>Overall, this was an encouraging quarterly report for GOOG that demonstrated the resiliency of its business and created more enthusiasm for the upcoming AI launches that will enhance its search engine.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
