<html><body><p>Ever since OpenAI launched its ChatGPT chatbot in November 2022, the hype surrounding generative AI has exploded, but there's nothing artificial about how the emergence of this technology is igniting a powerful growth catalyst for chip maker <strong>NVIDIA</strong> (<strong>NVDA</strong>). <br><br>Last night, NVDA delivered an unforgettable Q1 earnings report in which it not only easily surpassed quarterly EPS and revenue estimates, but it also issued Q2 revenue guidance that made a mockery of analysts' estimates. In fact, the magnitude of upside was so great that we initially believed there may have been an error in regard to the consensus estimate figure. However, looking back at NVDA's Q1 guidance of $6.37-$6.63 bln, we found that the company itself badly underestimated the level of demand for its GPUs.</p><ul><li>NVDA's Q2 revenue guidance of $11.0 bln, plus or minus 2%,  crushed estimates by about $4.0 bln, launching the stock to new all-time highs and taking other AI-focused semiconductor stocks for a ride higher, too. </li><li>For instance, competitor <strong>Advanced Micro Devices</strong> (<strong>AMD</strong>) is making an impressive move higher, as is <strong>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing</strong> (<strong>TSM</strong>), which makes NVDA's chips.</li></ul><p>Simply stated, NVDA's spectacular earnings report put it at the center of the AI universe. </p><ul><li>The company's Data Center segment in particular is perfectly positioned to capitalize on what CEO Jensen Huang has called a "ten-year transition" to retool data centers in order to support&nbsp;accelerated computing and generative AI.</li><li>This transition will touch upon almost any industry one can think of. As Mr. Huang stated in the earnings press release, companies are "racing to apply generative AI into every product, service, and business process." </li><li>Critically, NVDA doesn't seem to be contending with any serious supply chain issues or materials shortages, stating that it's significantly increasing supply to meet the surge in demand.</li></ul><p>NVDA is only in the first inning of this growth cycle. </p><ul><li>Revenue actually decreased by about 13% in Q1, but the company's Q2 guidance calls for a huge upswing in growth to 64% at the midpoint. The good news doesn't end there.</li><li>The company's data center chips, including&nbsp;H100, Grace CPU, Grace Hopper Superchip, and&nbsp;Quantum 400 InfiniBand, carry higher average selling prices than its other chips. </li><li>As data center becomes an even larger portion of NVDA's overall mix, margin expansion and earnings growth are sure to follow. On that note, NVDA guided for Q2 non-GAAP gross margin of 68.6%-70.0%, plus or minus 50 bps, compared to its Q1 non-GAAP gross margin of 66.8%.</li></ul><p>NVDA was already an expensive stock heading into the earnings report with a forward P/E of about 45x. </p><ul><li>Now, the stock's valuation looks even more egregious with a forward P/E of about 61x. </li><li>However, earnings estimates are bound to move sharply higher in the coming days, and it's hard to argue that NVDA doesn't warrant a premium valuation based on its accelerating growth and its optimal positioning as the key force behind the explosion of AI.</li></ul><p>The main takeaway is that this quarter is seen as a landmark moment for NVDA, establishing itself as the leader in the emergence of AI technology.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
