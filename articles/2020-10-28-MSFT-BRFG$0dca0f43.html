<html><body>Bolstered by continuous strong growth for its Azure cloud services, <strong>Microsoft</strong> (<strong>MSFT</strong>) reported impressive blow out 1Q21 results after the close yesterday. In fact, the company's $0.46/share bottom line beat represents MSFT's largest earnings beat in over five years.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This strong quarterly performance is overshadowed by MSFT's tepid 2Q20 revenue guidance of $39.50-40.40 bln, which came up just short of analysts' $40.51 bln expectation.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The slight shortfall may seem trivial. However, following the discouraging earnings reports and/or outlooks presented recently by other tech leaders, such as <strong>Intel</strong> (<strong>INTC</strong>), <strong>SAP</strong> (<strong>SAP</strong>), and <strong>IBM</strong> (<strong>IBM</strong>), MSFT's guidance miss adds to a troubling narrative: growth is under pressure as enterprises scale back on IT spending and push out projects due to COVID-related macroeconomic concerns.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">At the mid-point of MSFT's guidance, Q2 revenue is projected to increase by ~8.5% compared to 12.4% growth in Q1. What's especially concerning is that growth in the Intelligent Cloud segment, which has been MSFT's main growth engine, is expected to slow to 15% from 20% this quarter.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The Intelligent Cloud segment houses MSFT's highly successful Azure portfolio, which grew by 48% in Q2. Although MSFT didn't break out its expectations for Azure growth in Q3, it's reasonable to assume that MSFT is anticipating a deceleration based on the Intelligent Cloud segment guidance. <br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Another disappointment is that the More Personal Computing (MPC) segment is losing steam. This business includes Windows OEM, Surface, and Gaming products and has benefited from increased demand related to working, learning, and gaming at home.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">After experiencing growth of 14% in Q4, revenue for MPC increased by 6% in Q1 and is forecasted to slide to 2% in Q2.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">MSFT's soft MPC guidance is surprising because the company is launching its new Xbox gaming console next month. CFO Amy Hood believes that demand for the new console will be quite healthy, estimating that gaming hardware sales will jump by 40% in Q2. <br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Furthermore, demand for Surface computers has been strong, up 37% this quarter, as employees add devices to support the work-from-home transition.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The laggard in this segment, Windows OEM, experienced a 5% drop in revenue this quarter, and it seems that MSFT is anticipating more weakness for the product in Q2.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">MSFT's overall quarterly performance was exceptional. When coupled with the modest downside guidance, it may seem surprising that MSFT is trading materially lower today. The issue, though, is that MSFT's outlook calls for slowing growth in its Intelligent Cloud segment, which has been a bedrock of MSFT's improved growth profile. Additionally, since that segment has heavy exposure to enterprise spending, the cautious forecast plays into mounting angst about a deteriorating IT spending environment.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
