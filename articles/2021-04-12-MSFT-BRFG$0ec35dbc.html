<html><body>Over the weekend, <em>Bloomberg </em>reported that <strong>Microsoft</strong> (<strong>MSFT</strong>) is in advanced discussions to acquire voice recognition leader <strong>Nuance Communications</strong> (<strong>NUAN</strong>) for $56/share. Earlier this morning, those rumblings were confirmed after the companies announced that a deal was signed at that price in an all-cash transaction valued at nearly $20 bln. <br><br>At $56/share, MSFT is paying a 23% premium to last Friday's closing price for NUAN. That's a healthy increase, but we view the price tag as quite reasonable. Based on current analyst estimates for NUAN, the software giant is paying roughly 10-11x forecasted FY22 revenue. In today's climate, it's common for a cloud software stock to trade with a P/S north of 20x.<br><br>NUAN's recent financial performance and growth don't necessarily warrant a sky-high valuation, but the arrow is pointing up as the company completes its transition to focus on cloud-based healthcare offerings. Over the past few years, NUAN has trimmed its portfolio, divesting its medical transcription and EHR services business, its imaging division, and its automotive AI unit, among others. Simultaneously, the company has been transitioning its customer base away from on-premise products toward cloud-based systems, creating a stronger recurring revenue business model in the process.<br><br>This transition has come at a cost. In seven of the last eight quarters, NUAN's top line has declined on an yr/yr basis. The prognosis isn't much better for FY21, with analysts forecasting a 7% drop in revenue. However, the outlook is much brighter for next year, as revenue is projected to grow by 7% to $1.5 bln.<br><br>With most of the heavy lifting behind NUAN regarding its transformation, MSFT's acquisition proposal seems well-timed. The addition of the streamlined NUAN will instantly bolster MSFT's presence in the healthcare sector, which is a space that the company is increasingly focusing on. For instance, MSFT launched Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare last year, enabling healthcare organizations to coordinate care and drive operating efficiency, while providing security, compliance, and interoperability of health data.<br><br>Although MSFT is a relative newcomer to the healthcare space, the addition of NUAN is expected to double its total addressable market to nearly $500 bln.<br><br>The crown jewels of the acquisition are NUAN's Dragon Medical One (DMO) and Dragon Ambient Experience (DAX) cloud offerings. DMO is a speech recognition platform that allows physicians and clinicians to document patients' health records easily and securely; DAX, meanwhile, is an AI-powered voice solution that's used in telehealth, urgent care, and primary care settings. <br><br>Last quarter, revenue for DMO and DAX jumped by 22% yr/yr, driven by the ongoing transition of NUAN's installed base to Dragon Medical One, as well as traction in international, ambulatory, and community hospital markets.  <br><br>Momentum for these products is building as NUAN executes its land-and-expand approach, but MSFT still expects the deal to be minimally dilutive to non-GAAP earnings this year. That factor could be a cause for disappointment this morning. <br><br>Longer term, though, the acquisition looks appealing because it provides MSFT with a boost in two high-growth arenas: healthcare technology and AI. Furthermore, MSFT projects that the deal will be accretive to earnings next year once NUAN is fully integrated and is contributing more fully to sales.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
