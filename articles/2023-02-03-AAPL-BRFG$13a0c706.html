<html><body><p><strong>Apple (AAPL)</strong> is amid a strong comeback today despite registering top- and bottom-line misses in Q1 (Dec) due to a continually unfavorable macroeconomic environment. Also, the tech giant forecasted Q2 (Mar) sales performance to mirror Q1, translating to another rare yr/yr decline and below analyst projections.</p><p>  In addition to weakening consumer sentiment, AAPL faced other challenges outside its control, including a relatively strong U.S. dollar and supply chain constraints. These headwinds resulted in adjusted earnings slipping by 10.5% yr/yr to $1.88 and revs sinking by 5.5% to $117.15 bln, AAPL's first quarterly decline since 2Q19 (Mar). Additionally, the revenue from iPhones, Macs, and wearables missed analyst estimates in the quarter. </p><p> However, despite the tepid headline results and climbing over 20% to start the year, shares are holding up nicely today, recouping their initial losses. </p><ul><li> A significant factor buoying the stock was that AAPL has more of a supply problem than a demand one, similar to last quarter. iPhone supply could not keep pace with demand in Q1, causing ship times to extend well beyond what AAPL anticipated. </li><li> Also, although iPhone supply was constrained during the quarter, AAPL managed to keep sales from dipping, maintaining relatively flat iPhone revs yr/yr at $65.8 bln. Meanwhile, iPad revenue jumped by over 13% yr/yr to $9.4 bln, crushing the consensus, which called for a single-digit decline. <ul><li>On the flip side, AAPL does not expect iPad to continue seeing growth, forecasting a double-digit decline yr/yr in MarQ. AAPL provided the same outlook for Mac sales. </li></ul></li><li> It was also encouraging to hear CEO Tim Cook comment that production is now back to where it should be, especially after several disruptions in China throughout the past few months sparked heightened uncertainty. As a result, AAPL projects iPhone revs to accelerate sequentially in MarQ. </li><li>Furthermore, if not for foreign exchange impacts, which clipped 800 bps off sales growth in the quarter, AAPL would have seen positive growth yr/yr and posted growth in most of the markets it tracks. The same story will also play out in MarQ, as AAPL projects FX headwinds to dent sales growth by 5 pts. </li><li>AAPL also reached a milestone in the quarter, boasting over two billion active devices as part of its installed base, double the figure from seven years ago. The significance of this achievement is that it represents a sturdy foundation for future ecosystem expansion. </li></ul><p>AAPL tempered expectations heading into Q1, expecting revs to decelerate sequentially and Mac revs to experience a substantial decline due to challenging comps. As a result, although its Q1 report was not exactly crisp, AAPL delivered relatively decent numbers, especially when stacked against the numerous obstacles it had to endure.</p><p>  It is crystal clear by now that 2023 will be a turbulent year for tech firms with heavy consumer exposure. However, it is hard to bet against AAPL and its exceptional brand loyalty, especially when the company continues to demonstrate that demand remains sound.    </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
