<html><body>The global semiconductor shortage, which has already cost auto manufacturers <strong>General Motors</strong> (<strong>GM</strong>) and <strong>Ford</strong> (<strong>F</strong>) billions in lost production, has apparently taken a turn for the worse and is now spilling over into the consumer electronics market. According to <em>Nikkei Asia</em>, <strong>Apple</strong> (<strong>AAPL</strong>) is postponing production of some MacBooks and iPads due to supply chain constraints, illustrating that even the most prominent companies with the best procurement abilities are now being impacted by the shortage.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Despite the seemingly alarming news, investors are taking the development in stride. The calm reaction is likely attributed to the belief that any lost sales from production delays will be made up later in the year when the supply imbalance is corrected. On a related note, last month GM announced that it extended downtime at select plants because of the chip shortage but that it also anticipates recovering lost car and crossover production in 2H21.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Additionally, the story doesn't come as a huge surprise. In mid-March, major AAPL supplier <strong>Samsung</strong> (<strong>SSNLF</strong>) warned of the serious supply/demand imbalance that's occurring in the semiconductor industry. Not coincidentally, Nikkei's article specified that AAPL is experiencing shortages in displays and display components, which SSNLF supplies to AAPL.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">There's also a sense that the supply chain constraint will iron itself out as more chip production eventually comes online. Recall that <strong>Taiwan Semi</strong> (<strong>TSM</strong>), the world's largest chip producer, recently announced plans to invest $100 bln over the next three years to expand its capacity. <strong>Intel</strong> (<strong>INTC</strong>) soon followed suit, announcing on March 24 that the company will spend $20 bln to build two new factories in Arizona. It will take some time for these new plants to begin production, but the mere concept that a substantial influx of supply is needed to meet rapidly rising demand isn't the worst scenario to contemplate. <br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Indeed, the semiconductor industry is experiencing a tidal wave of demand from multiple arenas, all at the same time. The work-from-home trend created a surge in sales for PCs and personal electronics, while the ever-increasing amount of data stored on the cloud is causing a burst in demand for chips from data center providers. These shocks to the supply chain left auto OEMs in a pinch when vehicle sales ramped higher due to pent-up demand following plant and showroom closures. Now, as chip makers tend to the auto industry's needs, it appears that the consumer electronics industry is being squeezed. <br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">While the chip shortages may cause some temporary headaches for AAPL and potentially for its customers in the coming months, the broader outlook remains quite favorable in our view. The continuing advancement of 5G technology and AI should only add to the momentum stemming from last October's iPhone 12 launch.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
