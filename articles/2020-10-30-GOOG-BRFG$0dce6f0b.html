<html><body>After the close yesterday, market participants were greeted with a set of mega-cap earnings reports from companies such as <strong>Apple</strong> (<strong>AAPL</strong>), <strong>Amazon</strong> (<strong>AMZN</strong>), <strong>Facebook</strong> (<strong>FB</strong>), and <strong>Alphabet</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>). The prevailing feeling surrounding this batch of key financial reports is disappointment, as reflected in the slide in the broader stock market. <br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">However, GOOG's impressive 3Q20 results stand above the rest, enabling its stock to outperform its mega-cap tech peers today.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The search and cloud giant faced elevated expectations heading into the print due to the strong quarterly performances from <strong>Snap</strong> (<strong>SNAP</strong>) and <strong>Pinterest</strong> (<strong>PINS</strong>). Those social media companies experienced a burst in revenue growth as companies ramped up advertising campaigns, signaling that GOOG's search business might also post significantly improved results.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">GOOG did just that, reporting EPS of $16.40 (+62% yr/yr) and revenue of $46.2 bln (+14% yr/yr), crushing the $11.20 and $42.8 bln consensus estimates.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The recovery in GOOG's core search business (~55% of revenue), which generates revenue from ads, was striking, as the segment's revenue increased by 6.5% compared to a 10% decline last quarter. There was some question regarding whether advertisers were channeling more spending towards sites with unique attributes like PINS (less controversial content), but the jump in GOOG's advertising revenue shows that the increase was broad-based.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Underscoring that point, during the earnings conference call, CEO Sundar Pichai stated that the company saw improvement in advertiser spending across all geographies and most verticals.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As economies reopened during the summer, businesses began loosening marketing budgets. GOOG's dominant search engine is an enticing option for advertisers because people have flooded the internet in search of COVID-19 info, business openings and hours, job openings, political news, and online course availability, among other topics.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">This surge in advertising spend flowed through to YouTube, which generated revenue of $5 bln, up 32% yr/yr compared to 5.5% growth last quarter. The acceleration was driven by strengthening demand from brand advertisers and substantial growth in direct response ads.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">While the pandemic hindered the advertising business earlier this year, Google Cloud has been remarkably resilient. Following a 52% jump in revenue last quarter, Cloud revenue grew by 43% this quarter to $3.44 bln. <br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">GOOG's steady and healthy cloud growth is fueled by a couple main trends. The digitization of businesses creates the need for data processing and analytics, which Google Cloud provides. Additionally, enterprises are continually moving more data to the cloud to improve efficiencies and lower IT costs.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Moving forward, Google Cloud will become an increasingly important piece of the company's overall business. Last night, Pichai commented that GOOG will invest aggressively in Cloud while expanding the global footprint of its infrastructure.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The bottom line is that GOOG delivered very solid results, easily surpassing heightened expectations. The pronounced turnaround in its advertising business is mainly responsible for the huge beat, but GOOG's future growth increasingly rests on its cloud offerings as the company aggressively ramps up investments in that segment.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
