<html><body><p>With shares hovering around all-time highs, <strong>NVIDIA</strong> (<strong>NVDA</strong>) is set to report Q2 results after the close today with a conference call to follow at 5:00 pm ET. The maker of graphic processing units (GPUs) has been on a roll, easily surpassing analysts' EPS and revenue expectations in each of the past three quarters.<br><br>The company's impressive performance has raised the bar heading into tonight's report. Given the stock's ~40% run since its Q1 report, and an accompanying 1-year forward P/E of ~62x, NVDA will need a very strong showing to keep the upward momentum going.&nbsp;<br><br>For the quarter, NVDA is expected to post EPS and revenue of $1.97 and $3.66 bln. On a yr/yr basis, an inline quarter pencils out to EPS and revenue growth of 59% and 41%, respectively. Not only will NVDA need to exceed these Q2 growth rates, but it will also need to issue Q3 revenue guidance above the current $3.97 bln consensus estimate.</p><p>NVDA, which is traditionally known for producing gaming system chips, has increasingly strengthened its presence in the datacenter realm. This strategy has paid major dividends for the company and represents a key catalyst behind its recent success.<br><br>Last quarter, data revenue surged by 80% to $1.14 bln, accounting for&nbsp;37% of total revenue. Within this segment, there are a couple primary factors driving NVDA's robust growth:</p><ul><li>In the past, GPUs weren't seen as an important component of data centers. However, as&nbsp;data centers become more complex and field massive amounts of information, GPUs have increasingly become part of the mix in the architecture.</li><li>An ever-increasing number of enterprises are moving data off-premise and onto the cloud. The pandemic has accelerated this trend as more work and data moves off site,&nbsp;creating the need to access data and networks from various locations.</li></ul><p>While NVDA's datacenter business excels, the company's core gaming unit has also generated solid results. In Q1, revenue climbed by 27% to $1.33 bln, as stay-at-home rules ignited a rise in gaming. In turn, demand for NVDA's gaming laptop chips accelerated.<br><br>As social distancing measures have eased since the end of Q1, NVDA's gaming unit may have experienced a slowdown. However, looking ahead, <strong>Microsoft</strong> (<strong>MSFT</strong>) and <strong>Sony</strong> (<strong>SNE</strong>) are expected to launch new gaming consoles later this year. Combined with ongoing strength in laptops, the gaming unit looks poised to deliver healthy growth over the next couple of quarters.<br><br>While the arrow is clearly pointing up heading into tonight's print, one risk that investors should be aware of is that higher-than-expected acquisition costs could ding NVDA's bottom line. On April 27, NVDA completed its $7 bln acquisition of Mellanox. Due to costs associated with the acquisition, the company expects&nbsp;GAAP gross margin to slip to 58.1%-61.1% compared to gross margin of 65.1% in Q1. </p><p>However, since these are non-recurring expenses, we wouldn't expect the reaction to be overly severe even if costs are more than the company projected. The much more prominent risk is that NVDA faces sky-high expectations and that anything other than a sizable beat will be viewed as a disappointment.<br><br><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
