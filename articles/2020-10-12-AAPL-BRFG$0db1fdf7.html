<html><body><p><strong>Apple </strong>(<strong>AAPL</strong>) is providing a boost to the stock market today, trading higher in anticipation of its special event tomorrow at 1:00 p.m. E.T. The event is widely expected to feature the reveal of AAPL's new 5G-enabled iPhone 12.<br><br>Accounting for 55% of revenue in FY19, the iPhone remains the "core" of AAPL's business. Given the financial importance of the iPhone and AAPL's popularity among investors and consumers, the iPhone launch event always generates considerable excitement.<br><br>This year's iPhone presentation is unique and may attract even more interest than normal.</p><ul><li>As the new model represents AAPL's first 5G phone, there is plenty of curiosity revolving around its speed and performance. While the general desire to own a 5G-enabled phone will spur sales, some consumes may hold off until the technology catches up to the phone's capabilities. <ul><li>Most current 5G networks in the U.S. are only slightly faster than 4G networks. Some analysts believe that it will be several years before the U.S. is widely using faster high-band spectrum, which can operate 10-20x faster than 4G.</li><li>Similarly, many applications that will run on 5G, like virtual reality and car connectivity features, won't be available until the faster network is built out.</li></ul></li><li>Pricing will be another key point of interest. Recall that AAPL surprised people last year by offering the iPhone for a starting price of $699, below the $749 price for the preceding XR model. <ul><li>A lower starting price isn't expected again this year; several reports indicate a price range of $699 - $1,099. </li><li>Four models are expected, including two iPhone 12s and two iPhone 12 Pros, with screen sizes varying among 5.4, 6.1, and 6.7 inches. </li></ul></li><li>New iPhone models are typically launched in September, but this year's line-up was delayed due to COVID-related production setbacks. Assuming phones are available for sale in the next week or two, AAPL will be able to provide commentary around initial iPhone 12 results when it reports earnings on October 29.</li></ul><p>Last November, AAPL told its supply chain partners to plan for more than 100 mln iPhone orders this year. The virus has put a serious dent in that FY20 projection, but a couple promising data points emerged over the past couple weeks.</p><ul><li>Last Thursday, AAPL supplier and semiconductor maker <strong>NXP Semi</strong> (<strong>NXPI</strong>) raised its Q3 guidance, citing "material improvement in demand across all end markets, but particularly in the automotive and mobile end markets."</li><li>This followed <strong>STMicroelectronics'</strong> (<strong>STM</strong>) raised guidance from October 1. At ~18% of total revenue, AAPL is by far STM's largest customer. In its press release, STM also credited strength in the automotive and mobile end markets.</li></ul><p>Separately, AAPL also announced that it will now ship products from its stores to guarantee faster deliveries. With AAPL's stores now also becoming distribution centers, the company can get iPhones to customers much more quickly. This strategy is also relevant because many consumers are avoiding busy stores for health reasons.<br><br>Tomorrow is perhaps the most anticipated day of the year for AAPL, and investors are clamoring to the stock as the excitement builds. Demand for the new iPhone will be healthy, but there is risk that some consumers may hold off on upgrading phones until 5G networks are fully advanced.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
