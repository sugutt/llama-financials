<html><body><p><strong>NVIDIA (NVDA +1%)</strong> is powering its way toward highs not seen since April 2022 following an upgrade to "Overweight" from "Equal Weight" at Morgan Stanley today. The upgrade follows a recent upgrade from Goldman Sachs in late February to "Buy" from "Neutral." It also comes after considerable price appreciation. Shares of NVDA have surged by 80% on the year and over 130% since October lows. Still, the stock trades roughly 25% below all-time highs in late 2021. </p><p><strong>Briefing.com notes</strong> that with NVDA leaning on AI trends heavily, which have gained considerable steam since the explosive popularity of ChatGPT, more upgrades could be coming. </p><ul><li> NVDA recently discussed its role in powering AI during a Morgan Stanley technology conference earlier this month. During its presentation, management outlined why AI remains a critical computing component. NVDA also repeated that AI is at an inflection point, stemming from generative AI, e.g., ChatGPT, becoming more mainstream. ChatGPT changes how consumers and enterprises think about AI and how they can benefit from it, whether monetarily or through efficiency gains. </li><li>Customers of all sizes are emphasizing AI. For example, CEOs of large enterprises are focused on where they can utilize AI to their advantage, whether it is a more intuitive chatbot or a simulation of factories. Additionally, startups realize AI's potential through language models like GPT, buoying demand for NVDA's GPUs aimed at training AI models, which sometimes require hundreds of chips. </li><li> This inflection point is what is spurring so much exuberance around NVDA. Many companies are purely in the discussion phase, not yet having started building out their AI infrastructure, or they have grabbed onto an existing model but need more optimization. This future demand potential could be massive, and NVDA is going all-in on capturing the opportunities. </li></ul><p>As exciting as generative AI has proven to be, the road ahead may be bumpy. Complex, unpredictable environments, which require creativity and other human-based qualities, may not be easily tackled by AI, which is bound to its programming. Also, given that AI is only in its early stages, it is not a given that NVDA's chips will win the day; <strong>Advanced Micro (AMD)</strong> and<strong> Intel (INTC)</strong> are both competing to win the AI race.</p><p>  Nevertheless, NVDA's current positioning gives it a competitive edge to be the market leader in AI. Also, even if AI never evolves to solve complex situations, its total addressable market is expansive, from driverless vehicles to factory automation and answering search queries. Still, given its recent substantial appreciation, we urge caution buying NVDA at current levels and think it would be better to wait for a pullback, possibly around its 50-day moving average (209.06).</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
