<html><body><strong>Alphabet</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>) is displaying some modest weakness and is contributing to a more negative tone in the market today following a report that New York and 37 other states filed an antitrust lawsuit against the company. At the center of the lawsuit is the Google Play Store, which New York Attorney General Letitia James says is using anticompetitive tactics, including exclusionary contracts, to muscle out other mobile app distributors.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Among several different allegations, the litigation claims that GOOG implements technical barriers that strongly discourage or completely prevent app developers from distributing their apps outside the Google Play Store. Also being called into question is that GOOG's required contracts ensure that its apps be "pre-loaded" on virtually every device that runs on the Android OS.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For its part, GOOG is dismissing the lawsuit as "meritless", stating that it essentially mirrors the litigation brought forward by Epic Games, the developer of the ultra-popular Fortnite game. GOOG argues that anyone can download an app from any competing app store, or directly from the developer's website, using the Android OS. However, Epic Games says that <strong>Apple</strong> (<strong>AAPL</strong>) and GOOG force developers to use their payment systems, which charge steep commissions on all purchases. A ruling in Epic's case against AAPL is expected later this summer, which could set a potential precedent for a case against GOOG thereafter.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">These anticompetitive claims brought against GOOG are nothing new for the company. Along with tech giant counterparts like AAPL, <strong>Facebook</strong> (<strong>FB</strong>), and <strong>Amazon</strong> (<strong>AMZN</strong>), GOOG is under a global microscope as governments around the world impose an antitrust crackdown. The Chinese government and the measures it has taken against <strong>Alibaba</strong> (<strong>BABA</strong>) and <strong>Didi Global</strong> (<strong>DIDI</strong>) have garnered plenty of attention, but that country is certainly not alone in its mission to reign in massive tech companies.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">For instance, France has taken aim at GOOG, fining the company $268 mln in early June for antitrust issues. Later that month, the EU opened an investigation into possible anticompetitive practices conducted by GOOG in the online advertising space. <br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">On the home front, the House Judiciary Committee has put forward six bipartisan antitrust bills that could force some companies to shed business segments.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">With GOOG up nearly 50% year-to-date, it's safe to say that investors aren't overly concerned about these lawsuits and proposed regulations. The thought of GOOG dishing out money for fines -- even if such fines measure in the billions of dollars -- doesn't instill much fear into investors. It just seems unlikely that any new rule or regulation will seriously dent GOOG's dominant position in search and/or online advertising.<br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The fact that lawsuits continue to pile up and that GOOG is on the hot seat in terms of a global antitrust clampdown muddies the waters a bit for the stock. At this point, though, the risks associated with the rising amount of litigation is being largely discounted since a meaningful change to GOOG's competitive standing seems unlikely.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
