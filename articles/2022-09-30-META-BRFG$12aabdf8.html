<html><body><p>Coming off a rough Q2 in which <strong>Meta Platforms</strong> (<strong>META</strong>) missed EPS expectations, experienced its first ever yr/yr decline in revenue, and guided Q3 revenue well below expectations, the company is reportedly implementing a hiring freeze and a workforce restructuring program. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, CEO Mark Zuckerberg held a Q&amp;A session with employees this week, warning that the company will likely be smaller in 2023 compared to 2022, and that it will reduce budgets across most business areas. <br class="ContentPasted0"><br class="ContentPasted0">The news doesn't come as much of a surprise, though. Earlier this month, the<em> Wall Street Journal </em>reported that META is planning to reduce expenses by 10% in the coming months, including through job reductions. Additionally, META signaled during its Q2 earnings conference call that it planned to steadily reduce headcount growth over the next year, with Zuckerberg commenting that the macroeconomic situation "seems worse than it did a quarter ago."<br class="ContentPasted0"><br class="ContentPasted0">There was some hope that conditions were improving, and that advertising demand was picking up a bit when <strong>Snap</strong> (<strong>SNAP</strong>) issued upside Q3 revenue guidance on August 31. That forecast for 8% yr/yr growth, though, was accompanied by the disclosure that SNAP is also cutting its headcount by 20% in an effort to focus on profitability. Therefore, it was evident that SNAP wasn't anticipating demand to meaningfully recover anytime soon. Recent hiring freezes at <strong>Twitter</strong> (<strong>TWTR</strong>) and <strong>Google</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>) further solidify that notion.<br class="ContentPasted0"><br class="ContentPasted0">With META's looming headcount reductions adding to the gloom, it may seem strange that its stock is moving higher today. There are a few explanations for the strength.</p><ul><li>It's well understood that the digital advertising space is suffering a steep downturn. Likewise, META's troubles -- market share losses to TikTok and <strong>Apple's</strong> (AAPL) iOS privacy changes -- are largely baked into the equation, too, as illustrated by the stock's 60% year-to-date plunge.</li><li>Consequently, the focus has swung from META's top-line growth potential to its EPS and cash flow generation potential. Relatedly, cost cutting initiatives are now at the top of many investors' wish lists, and META has recognized that fact. On that note, the company lowered its FY22 expense guidance in both Q1 and Q2. After reducing its expense outlook to $87-$92 bln from $90-$95 bln in Q1, META further trimmed its expense outlook to $85-$88 bln last quarter.</li><li>Prior to this downturn in META's advertising business, there was plenty of skepticism regarding Zuckerberg's ambitious plans to invest billions into the metaverse. That intense focus on the metaverse seemed to come at the expense of META's social media platforms as TikTok and SNAP gained ground. Now, META is forced to re-prioritize its investments on applications that make it more competitive today, such as Reels, rather than on an idea that may never fully pan out.</li></ul><p>It's hard to feel too warm and fuzzy over META's gains today. Clearly, its latest plans to cut costs through hiring freezes and job reductions indicate that business conditions are not improving and may in fact be worsening. For now, though, investors are rewarding the company for trying to stay ahead of the curve and focus on profits as macroeconomic risks mount.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
