<html><body><p>In February 2022, <strong>NVIDIA</strong> (<strong>NVDA</strong>) abandoned its $40 bln bid to acquire semiconductor company Arm Ltd. after it became clear that regulators would never approve the deal due to antitrust concerns. However, even though NVDA scrapped its acquisition plans, its interest in Arm hasn't faded as the leading GPU maker reportedly considers making a substantial investment in Arm's upcoming IPO.</p><ul><li>According to <em>Financial Times</em>, NVDA is in discussions with Softbank-backed Arm to become an anchor investor in its IPO, potentially joining competitor <strong>Intel</strong> (<strong>INTC</strong>) in this venture. </li><li>About one month ago, <em>Bloomberg</em> reported that INTC was in line to become a strategic investor in Arm's IPO, which would expand INTC's exposure to AI as the chip maker continues to struggle through a major transition of building out its manufacturing base.</li></ul><p>Of course, the story for NVDA is much different.</p><ul><li>When the company issued its spectacular beat-and-raise earnings report on May 25, which featured Q2 revenue guidance that crushed expectations, it solidified its leadership position among chip makers that are driving this AI boom.</li><li>By investing in Arm's IPO, NVDA will turbocharge its AI capabilities -- albeit, from a distance that's more acceptable to regulators. </li><li>Although Arm may not be as familiar as NVDA or INTC to U.S. investors, it's a dominant force&nbsp;in the semiconductor industry with its chip designs powering the technology behind devices and products from <strong>Apple</strong> (<strong>AAPL</strong>), <strong>Samsung</strong> (<strong>SSNLF</strong>), <strong>Qualcomm </strong>(<strong>QCOM</strong>), among others. <ul><li>Unlike INTC or NVDA, the company is not a&nbsp;manufacturing company. Rather, it's more of a neutral designer of chips that licenses its technology to a wide variety of companies.</li></ul></li><li>Arm has ramped up its AI technology in recent years. In fact,&nbsp;Arm's portfolio of AI-ready chips is a major reason why NVDA was willing to shell out tens of billions of dollars to acquire the company. Arm's AI-optimized platform architecture is at the center of its GPU, CPU, and NPU product families.</li></ul><p>It's easy to understand why NVDA and INTC would be interested in becoming anchor investors in Arm's IPO, but the question of valuation still looms. </p><ul><li>According to reports, NVDA believes Arm's valuation should be in the $35-$40 bln range, while Arm is seeking a valuation closer to $80 bln. </li><li>Since NVDA tried to acquire Arm for $40 bln in 2020, though, it seems likely that the valuation will land somewhere closer to Arm's expectation.</li></ul><p>There are also major implications for the IPO market. While a specific date for Arm's IPO isn't set yet, it seems that September or October is the target timeframe. There have been some promising moments for the IPO market so far this year, including successful debuts from <strong>CAVA Group</strong> (<strong>CAVA</strong>), <strong>Structure Therapeutics</strong> (<strong>GPCR</strong>), <strong>Nextracker</strong> (<strong>NXT</strong>), and <strong>Kenvue</strong> (<strong>KVUE</strong>). However, none of these deals have opened the floodgates for the IPO market. A strong pricing and opening from Arm could be the game changer that the IPO market has been waiting for. With NVDA, INTC, and possibly a few other large companies backing the deal, a strong showing from Arm would seem very probable.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
