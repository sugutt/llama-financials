<html><body><p>Cost-cutting measures, a stabilization in ad spending, and a surprise turn to profitability in the Cloud segment enabled Google parent<strong> Alphabet </strong>(<strong>GOOG</strong>) to top 1Q23 EPS estimates, ending a streak of four consecutive earnings misses. GOOG, which helped kick off this earnings season for the tech sector, described its core Search business as "resilient" in Q1, while the Cloud segment once again delivered the strongest revenue growth at +28%.</p><ul><li>The upside results aren't the only piece of good news that the company had to share. GOOG also announced a huge $70 bln stock buyback authorization, providing the company with another EPS lever to pull while it continues to work through a cost restructuring program.</li><li>On that note, GOOG's cost-cutting initiatives, including the 12,000 layoffs it announced in January, did have an impact in Q1. This is reflected in its operating margin improving by six percentage points on a sequential basis to 30%.</li></ul><p>However, other aspects of GOOG's earnings report were less impressive.</p><ul><li>Most notably, YouTube ad revenue was down again, decreasing by nearly 3% to $6.69 bln. While that number did top analysts' muted expectations, and is better than last quarter's 8% drop, the general takeaway is that ad demand on the video platform remains soft. </li><li>In addition to the pullback in ad spending, competition from TikTok has cut into YouTube's market share. On the positive side, GOOG noted last night that YouTube Shorts -- its answer to TikTok's short format videos -- experienced an 80% surge in the number of channels that uploaded to Shorts.</li></ul><p>GOOG's financial results weren't necessarily the main event yesterday, though. Taking center stage was the company's updates on its AI/chatbot development, which GOOG's future growth largely hinges on.</p><ul><li>The primary message from the earnings call was that AI is now GOOG's primary focus and that the technology will be deployed across all of its products areas, including the advertising business.</li><li>Generative AI will not only create a top-line catalyst as its integrated into ads, phones, and the cloud, but it will also facilitate better cost efficiencies across the company by redistributing workloads within data centers.</li><li>GOOG was clearly bullish on its AI prospects. Whether this optimism is ultimately enough to ease the growing competitive concerns stemming from <strong>Microsoft</strong> (<strong>MSFT</strong>)/OpenAI's ChatGPT&nbsp; remains to be seen.</li></ul><p>Overall, we view GOOG's earnings report as a step in the right direction following a few rough quarters. While the ad business certainly isn't booming, it at least appears to have stabilized, which may bode well for <strong>Meta Platforms'</strong> (<strong>META</strong>) earnings report later today.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
