<html><body><p><strong>Microsoft (MSFT +3%)</strong> is no softie when it comes to its latest quarterly earnings. What stands out is that MSFT saw an acceleration in almost every area relative to its Q1 (Sep) results. </p><p>The software giant reported another large EPS beat with its Q2 (Dec) earnings report last night with $0.62 upside, following a $0.46 beat last quarter. It's also remarkable that a company of Microsoft's size can post 16.7% yr/yr revenue growth at $43.08 bln, which also was much better than expected. Furthermore, commercial cloud revenue jumped 34% yr/yr to $16.7 bln. </p><p>Revenue benefited from more than just one or two areas of growth. MSFT reported strong upside relative to prior guidance in all three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office 365, LinkedIn, Dynamics 365), Intelligent Cloud (Azure, SQL Server, Windows Server), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Surface, Xbox). </p><ul><li>In the <strong>PBP segment</strong>, Office Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 11% vs 9% in SepQ. LinkedIn revenue rose 23% yr/yr vs 16% growth in SepQ. Meanwhile, Dynamics products and cloud services rose 21% yr/yr vs 19% in SepQ, with Dynamics 365 revenue rising 39% yr/yr vs 38% growth in SepQ. </li><li> In the <strong>IC segment</strong>, its crown jewel is its Azure cloud computing business. Revenue growth bumped up to 50% yr/yr, up from 48% growth in SepQ and 47% growth in JunQ. </li><li>In the <strong>MPC segment</strong>, there were more ups and down. Xbox revenue jumped 40% yr/yr vs 30% growth in SepQ, fueled by the launch of a new and eagerly anticipated gaming console (Xbox Series X) this holiday season. Windows OEM revenue rose 1% yr/yr vs -5% in SepQ. However, Surface revenue slowed its growth to +3% yr/yr in DecQ vs +37% growth in SepQ, but that makes sense given that SepQ included the back-to-school season, which was fueled by the demands of remote learning. </li><li><strong>MSFT also provided upside revenue guidance</strong> for MarQ on the call. In its Consumer business, MSFT expects to see healthy demand for PCs and productivity tools continue. Gaming should see continued strong engagement on the Xbox platform while Search and LinkedIn should benefit from an improving advertising market. In commercial bookings, MSFT notes it has a growing Q3 expiry base and a low prior-year comparable. </li></ul><p>Our overall take is that the DecQ results are impressive. MSFT was not shy about its prospects. It says that what it's witnessing is the dawn of a second wave of digital transformation, sweeping every company and every industry. Finally, we're surprised that the stock is not trading up more robustly. The stock's reaction seems to be more one of selling-the-news and profit-taking, as the stock had run 9% in the past week heading into this report.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
