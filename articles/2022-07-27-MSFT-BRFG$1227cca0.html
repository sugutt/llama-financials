<html><body><p><strong>Microsoft (MSFT +4.5%) </strong>is trading nicely higher despite reporting its first EPS miss in many years. Initially, we thought the market might react negatively to the Q4 (Jun) report, but the stock has held up nicely and actually popped higher during the call last night thanks to some decently bullish guidance for Q1 (Sep). </p><p> <strong>So, why the big miss?</strong> </p><ul><li> <strong>FX had a big impact on results</strong> as the US dollar strengthened more quickly than expected. That clipped JunQ revenue and EPS by $595 mln and $0.04, respectively, beyond prior guidance. Recall that, on June 2, MSFT provided a rare intra-quarter update. It lowered guidance almost entirely caused by FX. And it turns out June saw a further strengthening in the dollar. If you back that out, MSFT almost reported in-line. </li><li><strong>Another headwind was extended production shutdowns </strong>in China that continued through May. Also, a deteriorating PC market in June impacted Windows OEM revenue by more than $300 mln. Also, clients have pulled back on ad spending, which hurt results at LinkedIn as well its search and news advertising segment. Another issue was that MSFT significantly scaled down operations in Russia, which were fairly large and led to an asset impairment charge. On this last point, it is frustrating that MSFT does not provide an adjusted EPS number. Things like an impairment charge should get backed out. It distorts the comparison to consensus. </li><li><strong>Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 40%.</strong> That is below the last few quarters, but only a point lower than internal expectations, driven by a slight moderation in Azure consumption growth. It is not surprising to see some moderation in growth as this segment gets larger. Also, MSFT says it is seeing larger and longer-term commitments for Azure and it won a record number of $100+ mln and $1+ bln deals this quarter. </li></ul><p><strong>Our overall thought here is that investors are giving a pass to MSFT</strong> for the miss because a lot of it was out of its control. MSFT faced severe FX headwinds with the rapid rise in the US dollar. The overall guidance was actually a bit below consensus. However, again, a lot of that shortfall appears to be FX-related. Based on the stock reaction, the guidance was actually a bright spot. Bigger downside guidance was certainly possible. </p><p> Finally, the stock has been in steady decline in 2022, which makes us think a lot of the negative items from this report were priced in already: FX headwinds, China shutdowns, PC weakness, Azure slowing a bit, reduced ad spend (see <strong>SNAP's</strong> recent report) etc. We think investors are looking past these items and are pretty pleased with the guidance. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2022 Briefing.com</body></html>
