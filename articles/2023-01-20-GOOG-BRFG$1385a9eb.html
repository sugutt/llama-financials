<html><body><p>Google parent <strong>Alphabet</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>) is providing the broader market with a needed boost today after announcing plans to reduce its workforce by approximately 12,000 positions, equating to about 6% of its staff.</p><ul><li>Layoffs across the tech sector have become commonplace lately, with <strong>Microsoft</strong> (<strong>MSFT</strong>) disclosing its intention to cut 10,000 jobs on Wednesday, preceded by workforce reductions at <strong>Amazon</strong> (<strong>AMZN</strong>), <strong>Meta Platforms</strong> (<strong>META</strong>), Twitter, and others. </li><li>However, despite repeatedly pledging to slow its pace of hiring, GOOG had remained a hold out in this layoff cycle. In fact, to the surprise of many, the company actually ramped up its hiring last quarter, adding nearly 13,000 employees.</li><li>That hiring spree pushed Q3 operating expenses higher by nearly 18%, far outpacing GOOG's topline growth of 6%, resulting in the company's third consecutive earnings miss. With growth slowing across the board, including YouTube's first ever yr/yr revenue decline (-2%) in Q3, it's obvious that GOOG was too slow in changing its course. </li><li>Since the macroeconomic picture and outlook for advertising demand in FY23 has only become murkier since the end of Q3, CEO Sundar Pichai is now acknowledging that the company "hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today."</li><li>The stock is reacting positively to the news, illustrating how investors continue to value margins and profits over growth. One of the more stunning aspects of GOOG's Q3 earnings report was that operating margin plunged by 7 percentage points yr/yr to 25%. That figure should represent a low point for the company as its streamlining actions take hold in the coming months.</li></ul><p>Overall, this isn't a very surprising move for GOOG given the soft demand backdrop and the job cuts seen across the tech&nbsp;sector. The company simply got ahead of itself with the rapid pace of its hiring, and now it's in correction mode. Ultimately, the action should result in a rebound for margins and profitability, which is music to investors' ears.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
