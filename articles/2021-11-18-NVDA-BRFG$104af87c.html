<html><body><p><strong>NVIDIA (NVDA +8%) </strong>is proving a "GeForce" to be reckoned with after posting another excellent quarter of record revenue across nearly every segment. As a result, despite trading at 73x forward earnings and soaring over 120% YTD, the stock remains chipper, continuing to run higher after the company delivered its OctQ earnings. </p><ul><li> In Q3 (Oct), NVDA posted earnings upside of $0.06, coming in much better than the two-cent beat reported in Q2 (Aug). Although that earnings upside may seem light, when adjusting for NVDA's stock split, EPS leaped 60% yr/yr. Revenue showed similar strength, jumping 50.3% yr/yr to $7.1 bln, ahead of consensus. </li><li> One of the standouts from the quarter was Data Center growth, which continued to shine, soaring 55% yr/yr and 24% sequentially to $2.94 bln despite lapping +37% growth from the year-ago period. Data Center revenue keeps encroaching on Gaming as NVDA's main business, making up over 41% of total sales in Q3, up about 160 bps from a year ago. We think this segment could quickly surpass Gaming revenue consistently - it already has done so once, in Q2 of last year - given its higher use cases, such as AI services for speech recognition, anomaly detection, and other analysis. </li><li> Still, in Q3, Gaming remained ahead of Data Center with revs of $3.22 bln, a 42% jump yr/yr. NVDA's latest RTX GPUs are proving to be a success, as PC gaming's popularity has remained elevated even after the height of the pandemic. For example, <strong>Activision Blizzard (AVTI)</strong>, the company behind popular PC titles such as the Warcraft franchise, saw total net bookings increase 6% yr/yr in Q3 despite having already soared 46% in 3Q20. </li><li> NVDA also doubled membership for its cloud gaming offering, GeForce NOW, through the past year to over 14 mln. This gaming-as-a-service platform allows anyone with a good internet connection to play major releases regardless of a title's system requirements, which has offered players a fantastic alternative to purchasing expensive gaming consoles and PCs, especially given that PS5 and Xbox consoles and GPUs have remained in short supply. </li><li> Finally, Automotive was the laggard in the quarter, just as it was in Q2, as chip shortages continued to impact NVDA's automotive partners. Revs grew just 8% yr/yr and fell 11% sequentially due to declining AI cockpit revenue as auto manufacturers struggled to secure enough parts. </li></ul><p>Overall, with another quarter of record revenue under its belt, NVDA is continuing its remarkable run YTD as investors applaud the company's ability to keep its growth rate above 50% thus far in FY22. NVDA also noted that it has secured guaranteed supply and feels good about its situation, particularly starting in the back half of 2022. </p><p> NVDA may be trading at a relatively high valuation of around 73x forward earnings -- for comparison, <strong>AMD (AMD)</strong> trades around 60x forward earnings and <strong>Intel (INTC)</strong> around 9x -- but its chips are powering necessary technologies across varying end markets, such as automotive, gaming, entertainment, and health care. Furthermore, NVDA's chips are still, in many cases, technologically superior to those of its rivals AMD and Intel. Therefore, as NVDA's end markets accelerate the pace at which they go digital and adopt the latest technologies, investors are looking far beyond 2022, and we think NVDA is in a prime position to continue to build upon its success. </p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
