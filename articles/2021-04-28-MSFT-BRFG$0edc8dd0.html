<html><body><p><strong>Microsoft (MSFT -3%)</strong> is no softie when it comes to earnings. The software giant came through with another big beat in Q3 (Mar). However, it seems investors are nitpicking that the $0.18 upside was not as robust as that of the prior two quarters, during which the company posted beats of $0.62 and $0.46. </p><p>It's remarkable that a company this large can post 19.1% yr/yr revenue growth to $41.71 bln, also surpassing expectations. MSFT says that even a year into the pandemic, digital adoption curves are not slowing down. In fact, they're accelerating, and that's evident in the MarQ results. </p><ul><li>In terms of revenue, growth did not result from just one or two business areas. MSFT reported strong upside relative to prior guidance in all three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office 365, LinkedIn, Dynamics 365), Intelligent Cloud (Azure, SQL Server, Windows Server), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Surface, Xbox). What really stands out is that MSFT saw an acceleration in growth in almost every area relative to its Q2 (Dec) results. </li><li>In the company's Commercial business, accelerating digital transformations, as enabled by Microsoft Cloud, drove demand for its hybrid and cloud offerings. MSFT says Azure consumption, increased platform commitments, and higher usage of Teams and security offerings were key beneficiaries. Within its small and medium business (SMB) segment, continued improvement in cloud purchasing trends offset transactional licensing weakness. Meanwhile, LinkedIn improved with the job market. </li><li> In its Consumer business, MSFT noted that Windows OEM and Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions benefited from a stronger than expected market for PCs, despite significant ongoing supply chain constraints. An improving advertising market benefited its Search and LinkedIn businesses. Finally, gaming continued to see record engagement and strong monetization as demand exceeded supply for the company's Xbox Series X and S consoles. </li><li>Azure revenue grew 50% yr/yr vs 50% growth in DecQ and 48% growth in SepQ. LinkedIn revenue rose 25% yr/yr vs 23% growth in DecQ. Dynamics 365 revenue rose 45% yr/yr vs 39% growth in DecQ. Xbox content and services revenue increased 34% yr/yr, down a bit from 40% growth in DecQ, but that was a holiday quarter. </li></ul><p><strong>So, why is the stock lower?</strong> We think MSFT is a victim of its own success. The quarter's EPS beat did not keep pace with those of recent quarters, and perhaps investors were disappointed that there was not a sequential increase in Azure sales growth. But this seems like nitpicking to us. We think we're seeing a sell-the-news reaction and profit-taking, as the stock had run 13% in the past month heading into this report. Rest assured, long-term investors, this was another solid quarter with no red flags that we can see.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
