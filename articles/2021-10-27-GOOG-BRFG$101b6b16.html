<html><body>In stark contrast to social media companies <strong>Facebook</strong> (<strong>FB</strong>) and <strong>Snap</strong> (<strong>SNAP</strong>), Google parent <strong>Alphabet</strong> (<strong>GOOG</strong>) easily surpassed estimates on the top and bottom lines in 3Q21, demonstrating the resiliency and strength of its business model.<br><br>GOOG's results, unlike those of FB and SNAP, were only minimally impacted by the privacy and tracking changes that <strong>Apple</strong> (<strong>AAPL</strong>) made to iOS 14. A main reason why GOOG escaped relatively unscathed is that the company organically collects vast amounts of user data through its search engine, making it less vulnerable to users opting out of mobile online tracking through AAPL's App Transparency Tracking system. Therefore, GOOG is retaining more valuable information pertaining to buying intentions and habits than FB or SNAP, making its platform more attractive to advertisers.<br><br>This differentiating factor, along with a healthy spending environment, produced strong results once again for GOOG's advertising business, which was up 43% yr/yr to $53.1 bln. During the earnings conference call, CFO Ruth Porat noted that momentum for advertising spending was broad-based but that retail continued its trend of outperformance relative to other areas. The one platform that was slightly impacted by the iOS changes was YouTube, as its revenue growth slowed to 44% from 84% last quarter. That deceleration, however, is also due to YouTube lapping a challenging yr/yr period in which 3Q20 revenue increased by 32%.<br><br>Another advantage that GOOG has over FB and SNAP is its cloud computing business. Google Cloud revenue growth of 45% helped to further insulate the company from AAPL-related headwinds. Keeping with recent form, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) grew faster than overall cloud, with particular strength experienced in platform-as-a-service and infrastructure-as-a-service. While it's understood that GOOG is investing for growth in the cloud business, and profitability isn't expected at this point, there may be some disappointment that cloud's operating loss widened to $(644) mln from $(591) mln last quarter.<br><br>The initial knee-jerk, sell-the-news reaction in the stock is probably more tied to investors simply taking some gains off the table. Since the beginning of October, shares have gained about 6%, compared to losses of 7% for FB and 26% for SNAP. Porat also reminded analysts and investors during the earnings call that GOOG's growth rate will likely slide in Q4 as the company laps a more difficult comp, but this scenario is already well-understood.<br><br>Those immediate losses were quickly erased once the market opened for trading, reflecting GOOG's impressive Q3 performance. Barring another major shock to the global macroeconomic landscape, it's hard to imagine that GOOG's momentum won't continue throughout the remainder of 2021 and into 2022.<BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2021 Briefing.com</body></html>
