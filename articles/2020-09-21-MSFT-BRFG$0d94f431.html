<html><body><p>With COVID-19 keeping many people at home, limiting entertainment and social options in the process, gaming has experienced an explosion of activity. Earlier this morning, <strong>Microsoft</strong> (<strong>MSFT</strong>) announced plans to acquire ZeniMax Media, the parent company of leading game developer Bethesda Softworks, making a substantial bet that the surge in gaming is more than a passing phenomenon.<br><br>MSFT will pay $7.5 bln in cash for the company, representing the company's largest acquisition in the space by a wide margin. Prior to the proposed purchase of Bethesda, MSFT's most significant gaming deal was its $2.5 bln buy-out of Minecraft in 2014.<br><br>Based on the impressive results in MSFT's gaming unit, it's safe to say that the Minecraft acquisition generously paid off. </p><ul><li>In 4Q20, MSFT's "More Personal Computing" segment  posted revenue of $12.9 bln (~33% of total revenue), up a healthy 14% yr/yr. This business also includes Windows and Surface products, but the growth was mainly attributable to a 64% jump in gaming revenue.</li><li>Describing the quarter as a "breakthrough for gaming", CEO&nbsp;Satya Nadella noted during the earnings conference call that Minecraft hit a new high of nearly 132 mln monthly active users.</li><li>MSFT's gaming subscription service, Xbox Game Pass, experienced record subscriber growth in Q4.&nbsp;<ul><li>Included in this morning's press release, MSFT stated that Xbox Game Pass subscribers now exceed 15 mln users.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The addition of Bethesda isn't expected to have a material financial impact for MSFT over the intermediate term. In fact, the company said it only expects a "minimal impact to non-GAAP operating income in FY21 and FY22".<br><br>However, the deal signifies MSFT's increasing focus on the gaming segment, which was once mostly an afterthought for investors and analysts.<br><br>Furthermore, the proposed acquisition bolsters the company's gaming menu, adding best-selling titles like "<em>The Elder Scrolls</em>" and "<em>Fallout.</em>" Bringing these games onboard, along with Bethesda's talent, improves MSFT's competitive standing versus rival <strong>Sony</strong> (<strong>SNE</strong>) and its PlayStation console.</p><p>Looking ahead, MSFT and SNE are set to launch next-generation gaming consoles in November, on time for the crucial holiday shopping season. Given the strong growth in the gaming space overall, expectations for these consoles are high.&nbsp;<br><br>While enterprise software is MSFT's bread-and-butter business, today's news is a clear indication that the gaming unit is gaining prominence within the company.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2020 Briefing.com</body></html>
